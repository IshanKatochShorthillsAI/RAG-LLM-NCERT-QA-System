For example, your\nmother may ask you to dissolve sugar\nin water to make a cold drink. Making a\nsugar solution is a change. Similarly,setting curd from milk is a change.\nSometimes milk becomes sour.  Souring\nof milk is a change. Stretched rubberband also represents a change.\nMake a list of ten changes you have\nnoticed around you.\nIn this chapter we shall perform some\nactivities and study the nature of thesechanges.  Broadly, these changes are oftwo kinds, physical and chemical.\nFig. 5.1   Paper pieces5.1  P HYSICAL  CHANGES\nActivity 5.1\nCut a piece of paper in four square\npieces. Cut each square piece further\ninto four square pieces.  Lay these pieceson the floor or a table so that the pieces\nacquire the shape of the original piece\nof paper (Fig. 5.1).\nObviously, you cannot join the pieces\nback to make the original piece, but isthere a change in the property of thepaper?\nActivity 5.2\nCollect the chalk dust lying on the floornear the chalkboard in your classroom.Or, crush a small piece of chalk into\ndust. Add a little water to the dust to\nmake a paste. Roll it into the shape of apiece of chalk. Let it dry.\nDid you recover chalk from the\ndust?\nActivity 5.3\nTake some ice in a glass or plastic\ntumbler. Melt a small portion of ice by\nplacing the tumbler in the sun. You havenow a mixture of ice and water. Now\nplace the tumbler in a freezing mixture\n(ice plus common salt).\nDoes the water become solid ice once\nagain?\nPhysical and\nChemical Changes\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 485.3 and 5.4, water changed its state (from\nsolid to liquid, or from gas to liquid). InActivity 5.5, the hack-saw blade\nchanged colour on heating.\nProperties such as shape, size, colour\nand state of a substance are called itsphysical properties . A change in which\na substance undergoes a change in its\nphysical properties is called a  physical\nchange. A physical change is generallyreversible. In such a change no new\nsubstance is formed.\nLet us now consider the other kind\nof change.\n5.2  C HEMICAL  CHANGE\nA change with which you are quitefamiliar is the rusting of iron.  If youleave a piece of iron in the open for some\ntime, it acquires a film of brownish\nsubstance.  This substance is called rust\nand the process is called  rusting\n(Fig. 5.2). Iron gates of parks orfarmlands, iron benches kept in lawnsand gardens, almost every article of iron,\nkept in the open gets rusted. At home\nyou must have seen shovels and spadesgetting rusted when exposed to theActivity 5.4\nBoil some water in a container. Do yousee the steam rising from the surface of\nwater? Hold an inverted pan by its\nhandle over the steam at some distancefrom the boiling water.  Observe the\ninner surface of the pan.\nDo you see any droplet of water\nthere?\nActivity 5.5\nFig. 5.2   Rusting ironCAUTION\nBe careful while handling a flame.\nHold a used hack-saw blade with a\npair of tongs. Keep the tip of the free\nend of the blade on the gas stove. Wait\nfor a few minutes.\nDoes the colour of the tip of the blade\nchange?\nRemove the blade from the flame.\nObserve the tip once again after some\ntime.\nDoes it get back its original colour?In Activities 5.1 and 5.2 above, you\nsaw that paper and a piece of chalk\nunderwent changes in size. In Activities\nReprint 2024-25\n\nPHYSICAL  AND CHEMICAL  CHANGES 49light (Fig. 5.3). When it is completely\nburnt it leaves behind a powdery ash.\nDoes the ash look like the\nmagnesium ribbon?\nThe change can be represented by\nthe following equation:\nMagnesium (Mg) + Oxygen (O2) \uf0ae\nMagnesium oxide (MgO)\nFig. 5.3  Magnesium ribbon burning\natmosphere for some time. In thekitchen, a wet iron pan ( tawa ) often gets\nrusted if left in that state for some time.\nRust is not iron.  It is different from iron\non which it gets deposited.\nLet us consider a few more changes\nwhere new substances are formed.\nActivity 5.6\n(To be demonstrated by the teacher)\nCAUTION\nIt is dangerous to look for long at the\nburning magnesium ribbon.  The\nteachers should advise children notto stare at the burning ribbon.\nGet a small piece of a thin strip or\nribbon of magnesium.  Clean its tip with\nsandpaper.  Bring the tip near a candle\nflame.  It burns with a brilliant whiteCollect the ash and mix it with a\nsmall amount of water. Stir the mixture(aqueous solution) well. Test the mixturewith blue and red litmus papers.\nDoes the mixture turn red litmus\nblue?\nDoes the mixture turn blue litmus\nred?\nOn the basis of this test, how do you\nclassify the aqueous solution \u2014 acidic\nor basic?\nOn dissolving the ash in water it\nforms a new substance. This change canbe written in the form of the following\nequation:\nMagnesium oxide (MgO) + Water\n(H\n2O) \uf0ae\uf020Magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH)2]\nAs you have already learnt in\nChapter 4, magnesium hydroxide is a base.\nSo, magnesium oxide is a new substance\nformed on burning of magnesium.Magnesium hydroxide is another newThe equations here are different from\nthose in mathematics. In equations\nof this kind, the arrow implies\u2018becomes\u2019. No attempt should be made\nto balance chemical equations at this\nstage.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 50\nsubstance formed by mixing magnesium\noxide with water.\nActivity 5.7\n(To be demonstrated by the teacher)Dissolve about a teaspoonful of copper\nsulphate (blue vitriol or neela thotha ) in\nabout half a cup of water in a glass\ntumbler or a beaker. Add a few drops of\ndilute sulphuric acid to the solution.\nYou should get a blue coloured solution.Save a small sample of the solution in a\ntest tube or a small glass bottle. Drop a\nnail or a used shaving blade into theremaining solution. Wait for half an\nhour or so. Observe the colour of the\nsolution. Compare it with the colour ofthe sample solution saved separately\n(Fig. 5.4).colour of the solution from blue to\ngreen is due to the formation of ironsulphate, a new substance. The brown\ndeposit on the iron nail is copper,\nanother new substance. We can writethe reaction as:\nCopper sulphate solution (blue) + Iron\n\uf0ae Iron sulphate solution (green)\n+ Copper (brown deposit)\nActivity 5.8\nTake about a teaspoonful of vinegar in\na test tube. Add a pinch of baking soda\nto it. You would hear a hissing soundand see bubbles of a gas coming out.\nPass this gas through freshly prepared\nlime water as shown in Fig. 5.5.\nWhat happens to the lime water?\nDo you see any change in the colour\nof the solution?\nTake out the nail or the blade.Has it changed in any way?\nThe changes that you notice are\ndue to a reaction between copper\nsulphate and iron. The change ofThe change in the test tube is as\nfollows:\nVinegar (Acetic acid) + Baking soda\n(Sodium hydrogencarbonate) \uf0ae\nCarbon dioxide + other substances\nThe reaction between carbon dioxide\nand lime water is as follows:Fig. 5.4   Change in colour of the copper sulphate\nsolution due to reaction with ironCopper sulphate\n(blue)Iron sulphate (greenish)\nReprint 2024-25\n\nPHYSICAL  AND CHEMICAL  CHANGES 51Carbon dioxide (CO2) + Lime water\n[Ca(OH)2] \uf0ae\uf020Calcium Carbonate\n(CaCO3) + Water (H2O)\nWhen carbon dioxide is passed\nthrough lime water, calcium carbonate\nis formed, which makes lime water milky.\nThe turning of lime water  into milky is a\nstandard test of carbon dioxide. You will\nuse it in Chapter 6 to show that the air\nwe breathe out is rich in carbon dioxide.\nIn Activities 5.6\u20135.8, you saw that\nin each change one or more newsubstances were formed. In Activity 5.6,the ash was the new substance formed\nwhen magnesium was burnt in air. In\nActivity 5.7, the reaction of copper\nsulphate with iron produced iron\nsulphate and copper.  Both of these are\nnew substances. Copper was depositedon the shaving blade of iron. In Activity\n5.8, vinegar and baking soda together\nproduced carbon dioxide, which turnedlime water milky. Can you name the new\nsubstance formed in this reaction?A change in which one or more\nnew substances are formed is called a\nchemical change . A chemical change\nis also called a chemical reaction .\nChemical changes are very important\nin our lives.  All new substances are\nformed as a result of chemical changes.\nFor example, digestion of food in ourbody, ripening of fruits, fermentation of\ngrapes, etc., happen due to series of\nchemical changes. A medicine is the endproduct of a chain of chemical reactions.\nUseful new materials, such as plastics\nand detergents, are produced bychemical reactions. Indeed, every new\nmaterial is discovered by studying\nchemical changes.\nWe have seen that one or more new\nsubstances are produced in a chemicalchange.  In addition to new products,the following may accompany a chemical\nchange:\n\uf06eHeat, light or any other radiation\n(ultraviolet, for example) may be given\noff or absorbed.\n\uf06eSound may be produced.\n\uf06eA change in smell may take place or\na new smell may be given off.\n\uf06eA colour change may take place .\n\uf06eA gas may be formed.\nLet us look at some examples.You saw that burning of magnesium\nribbon is a chemical change.  Burningof coal, wood or leaves is also a chemicalchange. In fact, burning of any\nsubstance is a chemical change.\nBurning is always accompanied byproduction of heat.Fig. 5.5  Set up to pass gas through lime water\nVinegar +\nBaking sodaCarbondioxide\nLimewater\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 52Explosion of a firework is a chemical\nchange. You know that such an\nexplosion produces heat, light, sound\nand unpleasant gases that pollute the\natmosphere. That is why you are advisednot to play with fireworks.\nWhen food gets spoiled, it produces\na foul smell. Shall we call this change achemical change?\nYou must have noticed that a slice of\nan apple acquires a brown colour if it isnot consumed immediately. If you have\nnot seen this change in colour, cut a\nfresh slice of apple and keep it away forsome time. Repeat the same activity with\na slice of potato or brinjal. The change\nof colour in these cases is due to theformation of new substances. Are not\nthese changes chemical changes?\nIn Chapter 4, you neutralised an acid\nwith a base.  Is neutralisation a chemicalchange?5.3 R USTING  OF IRON\nLet us get back to rusting. This is onechange that affects iron articles and\nslowly destroys them. Since iron is usedin making bridges, ships, cars, truck\nbodies and many other articles, the\nmonetary loss due to rusting is huge.\nThe process of rusting can be\nrepresented by the following equation:\nIron (Fe) + Oxygen (O\n2, from the air)\n+ water (H2O) \uf0ae\uf020 rust (iron oxide Fe2O3)\nFor rusting, the presence of both\noxygen and water (or water vapour)is essential.\nIn fact, if the content of moisture in\nair is high, which means if it is morehumid, rusting becomes faster.\nSo, how do we prevent rusting?\nPrevent iron articles from coming incontact with oxygen, or water, or both.\nOne simple way is to apply a coat of\npaint or grease. In fact, these coatsshould be applied regularly to prevent\nrusting. Another way is to deposit a layer\nof a metal like chromium or zinc on iron.A protective shield\nYou must have heard of the ozone layerin our atmosphere. It protects us fromthe harmful ultraviolet radiation which\ncome from the sun. Ozone absorbs this\nradiation and breaks down to oxygen.Oxygen is different from ozone. Can\nwe call the breaking down of ozone a\nchemical change?\nIf ultraviolet radiation were not\nabsorbed by ozone, it would reach theearth\u2019s surface and cause harm to usand other life forms. Ozone acts as a\nnatural shield against this radiation.\nWe learnt in Chapter 1 that\nplants produce their food by\na process called photosynthesis.\nCan we call photosynthesis\na chemical change?\nPaheli said that even digestion\nis a chemical change.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nPHYSICAL  AND CHEMICAL  CHANGES 53\nCopper sulphate\nCrystalsThis process of depositing a layer of zinc\non iron is called galvanisation . The iron\npipes we use in our homes to carry waterare galvanised to prevent rusting.\nYou know that ships are made of iron\nand a part of them remains under water.On the part above water also, waterdrops keep clinging to the ship\u2019s outer\nsurface. Moreover, the water of the sea\ncontains many salts. The salt watermakes the process of rust formation\nfaster. Therefore, ships suffer a lot of\ndamage from rusting in spite of beingformed from their solutions. The processis called crystallisation .  It is an\nexample of a physical change.\nActivity 5.9\n(To be performed in the presence of\nthe teacher)\nStainless steel is made by mixing ironwith carbon and metals like\nchromium, nickel and manganese.  Itdoes not rust.\nOh, that is why my friend\nRita is always complaining\nabout iron articles rusting so\nfast.  She lives near the coast.\nCAUTION\nUse only dilute sulphuric acid. Be\ncareful while boiling water.\npainted. So much so, that a fraction of\nship\u2019s iron has to be replaced every year.\nCan you imagine the monetary loss to\nthe world?\n5.4 C RYSTALLISATION\nIn Class VI you have learnt that salt canbe obtained by the evaporation of sea\nwater. The  salt obtained in this manner\nis not pure and the shape of its crystalscannot be seen clearly. However, large\ncrystals of pure substances can beTake a cupful of water in a beaker\nand add a few drops of dilute sulphuric\nacid.  Heat the water. When it startsboiling add copper sulphate powder\nslowly while stirring continuously\n(Fig. 5.6). Continue adding coppersulphate powder till no more powder can\nbe dissolved. Filter the solution.  Allow\nit to cool. Do not disturb the solutionwhen it is cooling. Look at the solution\nafter some time. Can you see the crystals\nof copper sulphate?  If not, wait for somemore time.\nFig. 5.6  Crystals of copper sulphate\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 54You have learnt about physical and\nchemical changes. Try to identifychanges that you observe around you\nas physical or chemical changes.\nWhat you have learnt\n\uf06eChanges can be of two types, physical and chemical.\n\uf06ePhysical changes are changes in the physical properties of substances.\nNo new substances are formed in these changes.  These changes maybe reversible.\n\uf06eIn chemical changes new substances are produced.\n\uf06eSome substances can be obtained in pure state from their solutions bycrystallisation.\nExercises\n1.

            "text": "SCIENCE 142Forests: Our Lifeline12\nOne evening Boojho entered the\npark with an elderly person. He\nintroduced him to his friends.\nProf Ahmad was a scientist working in\nthe university. The children started\nplaying while Prof Ahmad sat on a\nbench in the corner. He was tired as hehad participated in the golden jubilee\ncelebrations of the town. After a while,\nthe children also came and sat aroundhim. They wanted to know about the\ncelebrations. Prof Ahmad told them that\nafter the cultural programme, thesenior people discussed the town\u2019s\nunemployment problem. A plan was\nproposed to put up a factory by clearingan area of the forest just outside the\ntown. This would give the increasing\npopulation of the town a chance to getjobs. The children were very surprised\nwhen Prof Ahmad told them that many\npeople had objected to this idea.\u201cThis is because the forests serve as\ngreen lungs and water purifying systems\nin nature\u201d, Prof Ahmad explained. The\nchildren were confused. Prof Ahmadrealised that the children had not visited\na forest. The children also wanted to\nknow more about the forest, so theydecided to visit it with Prof Ahmad.\n12.1 V ISIT TO A FOREST\nOne Sunday morning, the children\npacked a few things like a knife, a hand\nlens, a stick, a notebook and walkedtogether through a forest trail near a\nvillage. On their way, they met Tibu, a\nyoung boy of their age group, of nearbyvillage, who was taking cattle for grazing\nalong with his aunt. He was very agile,\nrunning here and there to keep the herdtogether. When he saw the children,\nTibu also started walking along with\nthem, while his aunt went on a differentpath. As soon as they entered the forest\nTibu raised his hand and signalled them\nto keep quiet because noise coulddisturb the animals living in the forest.\nTibu then took them to a place at a\nheight to show them the broad view ofthe forest. Children were surprised\nbecause they could not see any land\n(Fig. 12.1). The different treetops hadformed green cover over the land. However,\nthe cover was not uniformly green. The\nFig. 12.1  A view of a forest\nReprint 2024-25\n\nFORESTS : OUR LIFELINE 143environment was peaceful and a cool\nbreeze was blowing. This made childrenquite fresh and happy.\nWhile coming down, they got excited\non hearing a sudden sound of birds andsome noise from the top branches of the\ntrees. Tibu told them to relax since it\nwas a normal phenomenon here.Because of the children\u2019s presence, some\nmonkeys had climbed higher up on the\ntrees where they disturbed the birds.Animals often give this type of warning\ncall to alert other animals. Tibu also told\nthat many other animals like boar,bison, jackals, porcupine, elephants live\nin the deeper areas of the forest\n(Fig. 12.2). Prof Ahmad cautionedchildren that they should not go deep\ninto the forest.\nBoojho and Paheli remembered that\nthey have studied about forests as\nFig. 12.2  Some forest animals\nFig. 12.3  Forest as habitat\nan example of a habitat in Class VI(Fig. 12.3). They could see now how the\nforest provides a home for many animalsand plants.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 144The land where the children were\nwalking was uneven and covered with\nmany trees. Tibu helped them to identify\nsal, teak, semal , sheesham , neem ,\npalash , fig, khair , amla , bamboo,\nkachnar (Fig. 12.4). Prof Ahmad pointed\nout that there are several other trees,shrubs, herbs and grasses in the forest.\nThe forest floor and the trees were alsocovered with different types of creepersand climbers. The sun was barely visible\nthrough the leaves of the trees, makingit quite dark inside the forest.\nActivity 12.1\nObserve the various things in your homeand make a list of those which are madefrom material which may have been\nobtained from the forest.\nYou might have many wooden items\non your list like plywood, fuel wood,boxes, paper, matchsticks, and\nfurniture. Do you know that gum, oils,spices, fodder for animals and medicinal\nplants are also some of the products\nwhich we get from the forest (Fig. 12.5).Fig. 12.4  Some forest plants\nSemal\nSheesham\nNeem\nBamboo o\nReprint 2024-25\n\nFORESTS : OUR LIFELINE 145Fig. 12.6  Some crown shapes\nBased on the products that we get\nfrom plants, try to fill Table 12.1. One\nexample of each plant is already given.\nFill the table by adding more examples.\nSheila wondered who would have\nplanted these trees. Prof Ahmad repliedthat in nature trees produce enough\nseeds. The forest floor providesfavourable conditions for them to\ngerminate and develop into seedlingsProf Ahmad asked children to look\nup and observe how the branches of the\ntall trees look like a roof over the other\nplants in the forest. He told them that\nthis is called a canopy (Fig. 12.7).\nActivity 12.2\nVisit a forest or a park in yourneighbourhood. Observe the trees and\ntry to identify them. You can take the\nhelp of some elders or books on trees.List the characteristics of the trees that\nyou observe, such as the height, shape\nof leaves, crown, flowers, and fruits. Alsodraw the crowns of some trees.\nProf Ahmad pointed out that trees\nhad crowns of different types and sizes.These had created different horizontal\nlayers in the forest. These are known as\nunderstoreys (Fig. 12.7). Giant and talltrees constituted the top layer followed\nby shrubs and tall grasses, and herbs\nformed the lowest layer.\nTable 12.1 Plants and their products\nGum Timber Medicinal Oil\nBabool Sheesham Neem Sandalwood\nSealing wax\nGumCatechu\nHoney\nWooden\nstatue\nFig. 12.5  Forest products\nand saplings.

They\nstarted making sketches of thesecreatures. The forest floor seemed dark\ncoloured and was covered with a layer\nof dead and decaying leaves, fruits,seeds, twigs and small herbs. The\ndecaying matter was moist and warm.\nChildren picked up various seeds and\nleaves for their collection. Walking overthe dead leaf layer on the forest floor\nwas like walking over a spongy carpet!\nIs the decaying matter always warm?\nProf Ahmad suggested that the childrencould perform an activity to get ananswer to this question.Fig. 12.7  Canopy and under storeys in a forest\n\u201cWould we see similar kind of trees\nin every forest?\u201d\u2014asked Boojho.Prof Ahmad said, \u201cNo, due to different\nclimatic conditions there are variations\nin the types of trees and other plants.The types of animals also differ from\nforest to forest.\u201d\nA few children were busy watching\nbeautiful butterflies fluttering here andthere on the flowers of shrubs and herbs.Understorey\nFig. 12.8  Forest floorCanopy\nReprint 2024-25\n\nFORESTS : OUR LIFELINE 147Fig. 12.9  Interrelationship of plant, soil and decomposers in a forest\nActivity 12.3\nDig a small pit. Put vegetable waste and\nleaves in it. Cover them with soil. Add\nsome water. After three days, remove the\nupper layer of the soil. Does the pit feelwarm inside?\nPaheli asked, \u201cThere are so many\ntrees here. Also, there are many forestlike this. What difference will it make if\nwe cut some trees for a factory?\u201d\nProf Ahmad said, \u201cYou have read\nabout autotrophs, heterotrophs andsaprotrophs. You have learnt how green\nplants produce food. All animals,whether herbivores or carnivores,depend ultimately on plants for food.Organisms which feed on plants oftenget eaten by other organisms, and so\non. For example, grass is eaten by\ninsects, which in turn, is taken by thefrog. The frog is consumed by snakes.\nThis is said to form a food chain:\nGrass\uf0ae insects\uf0ae frog\uf0ae snake\uf0ae eagle.\nMany food chains can be found in the\nforest. All food chains are linked. If any\none food chain is disturbed, it affectsother food chains. Every part of the\nforest is dependent on the other parts.\nIf we remove one component, say trees,all other components would be affected.\u201d\nPhotosynthesis\nSoilDecomposers\nOxygen\nCarbon dioxide\nWaterNutrients\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 148Paheli reminded Prof Ahmad that he\nhad not explained why forests are called\ngreen lungs. Prof Ahmad explained that\nplants release oxygen through the\nprocess of photosynthesis. The plantshelp to provide oxygen for animal\nrespiration. They also maintain theProf Ahmad asked children to pick\nup leaves from the forest floor andobserve them under a hand lens. They\nfound tiny mushrooms over the\ndecaying leaves. They also saw an armyof tiny insects, millipedes, ants andbeetle on them. They were wonderinghow these organisms live there. Prof Ahmad\nexplained that apart from these animals\nwhich are easily seen, there are several\norganisms and micro-organisms thatlive in the soil. Paheli wondered whatmushroom and other micro-organismseat. Prof Ahmad replied that they feedupon the dead plant and animal tissues\nand convert them into a dark coloured\nsubstance called humus .\nIn which layer of the soil would you\nfind humus? What is its importance tothe soil?\nThe micro-organisms which convert\nthe dead plants and animals to humusare known as decomposers . These\nmicro-organisms play an important rolein the forest. Soon, Paheli removed somedead leaves and discovered under thema layer of humus on forest floor.  The\npresence of humus ensures that the\nnutrients of the dead plants andanimals are released into the soil. Fromthere, these nutrients are again absorbedby the roots of the living plants. \u201cWhathappens if an animal dies in the forest?\u201d\nSheila asked. Tibu replied the dead\nanimals become food for vultures, crows,jackals and insects.\u201d In this way, thenutrients are cycled. So, nothing goeswaste in a forest (Fig. 12.9).\nFig. 12.10  Balance of oxygen and carbon\ndioxide\nPaheli reminded their\nfriends that they have\nstudied photosynthesis in\nChapter 1.\nbalance of oxygen and carbon dioxide\nin the atmosphere (Fig. 12.10). That is\nwhy forests are called lungs.\nThe children saw clouds forming in\nthe sky. Boojho recalled what he hadlearnt about the water cycle in Class VI.\nTrees take in water from their roots andrelease water vapour into the air\nthrough evaporation.\nIf there were fewer trees, how will the\nwater cycle be affected?\nTibu told them that the forest is not\njust home to plants and animals. Many\npeople also live in the forest. Some of\nReprint 2024-25\n\nFORESTS : OUR LIFELINE 149them may belong to different tribes. Tibu\nexplained that these people dependmostly on the forests. The forest provides\nthem with food, shelter, water and\nmedicines. They have traditionalknowledge about many medicinal plants\nin the forest.\nWhile Boojho was drinking water\nfrom a small stream, he saw some deer\ncrossing the stream (Fig. 12.11). They\ndisappeared into the bushes. The dense\nbushes and the tall grass provide\nanimals with the food and shelter. Theyshowed the children droppings of some\nanimals, and explained the difference\nbetween various types of droppings.\nProf Ahmad informed them that theforest officers could recognise the\npresence of some animals in the forest\nby their droppings and footprints.\nBoojho called every one and showed\nthem a large, decaying heap of animaldropping. Several beetles and grubswere feeding on the heap and a bunch\nof seedlings was sprouting. \u201cThese\nseedlings are of the herbs and shrubs.\nPaheli remembered that she\nsaw a Pipal sapling on the\nsidewall in her school. Can you\nhelp her to understand how this\nwould have happened?\nFig. 12.12  A sapling on a wall\nalso protect them from carnivores that\nlive in the forest.\nTibu then started looking closely at\nthe forest floor. Soon he called andThe animals also disperse the seeds of\ncertain plants and help the forest to growand regenerate. The decaying animaldung also provides nutrients to theseedlings to grow\u201d, said Prof Ahmad.\nAfter listening to this, Boojho noted\nin his notebook, \u201cBy harbouring greatervariety of plants, the forest providesgreater opportunities for food andhabitat for the herbivores. Largernumber of herbivores means increased\navailability of food for a variety ofFig. 12.11  Deer in a forest\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 150\ncarnivores. The wide variety of animals\nhelps the forest to regenerate and grow.\nDecomposers help in maintaining the\nsupply of nutrients to the growing plants\nin the forest. Therefore, the forest is a\n\u2018dynamic living entity \u2019 \u2014 full of life and\nvitality.\u201d\nIt was about afternoon and the\nchildren wanted to go back. Tibusuggested another route for going back.While they were going back, it started\nraining. However, surprisingly, they saw\nthat the raindrops were not hitting the\nforest floor directly. The uppermost layer\nof the forest canopy intercepted the flow\nof raindrops, and most of the water was\ncoming down through the branches and\nthe stems of the trees. From the leaves itFig. 12.13  Rainwater drips from the trees and seeps into the groundCovered ground with\ndecaying material actslike a spongeRain\nThe root system helpswater to seep down inthe groundThe closed canopy andmany layers of vegetationslow down the speed ofraindropsTranspiration and evaporation\nRoot system\nWater table\nReprint 2024-25\n\nFORESTS : OUR LIFELINE 151was dripping slowly over branches of the\nshrubs and herbs (Fig. 12.13). They\nfound that the ground was still dry. After\nabout half an hour, the rain stopped.\nThey noticed that the layer of dead\nleaves over the forest floor appeared wet\nnow. But water did not stagnate in the\nforest.\nBoojho thought that if it had rained\nso heavily in his town, it would have\nflooded the drains and roads.\nWhat would happen if it rains heavily\nin your town?\nProf Ahmad told them that the forest\nalso acts as a natural absorber of\nrainwater and allows it to seep. It helps\nmaintain the water table throughout the\nyear. Forests not only help in controlling\nfloods but also help maintain the flow\nof water in the streams so that we get a\nsteady supply of water. On the other\nhand, if trees are not present, rain hits\nthe ground directly and may flood the\narea around it. Heavy rain may also\ndamages the soil. Roots of trees normally\nbind the soil together, but in their\nabsence the soil is washed away or\neroded.\nThe children spent an hour at Tibu\u2019s\nvillage on their way back. The weather\nof the village was quite pleasant. Villagers\ntold them that due to the surrounding\nforest, they receive good rainfall. The air\nalso remained cool. Noise pollution, too\nis less because the forest absorbs the\nnoise of the nearby highway.\nThe children learnt about the history\nof the village. It surprised them that the\nvillages and the agricultural fields ofthat area were created after clearing the\nforest about sixty years ago. Tibu\u2019s\ngrandfather told them that when he was\nyoung, the village was not as large as it\nwas now. It was also surrounded\nby forests. Construction of roads,\nbuildings, industrial development and\nincreasing demand of wood created\npressure on the forests and it started\nvanishing. He was not happy that the\nforest adjoining their village is not\nregenerating and is on the verge of\ndisappearing due to overgrazing of\nanimals and indiscriminate felling of\ntrees. Prof Ahmad said that if we did\nthings wisely we could preserve forests\nand environment as well as have\ndevelopment.\nChildren prepared a few pictures to\nshow the consequences of such an\nevent.\nAt the end of the visit, Prof Ahmad\nasked children to sum up the\nimportance of forests. The children\nwrote: Forests provide us with oxygen.\nThey protect soil and provide habitat to\na large number of animals. Forests\nhelp in bringing good rainfall in\nneighbouring areas. They are a source\nof medicinal plants, timber and many\nother useful products.

You will findthat the image formed by a concave lensis always virtual, erect and smaller insize than the object (Fig. 11.27).\n11.6 S UNLIGHT  \u2014 W HITE OR\nCOLOURED ?\nHave you ever seen a rainbow in the\nsky? You might have noticed that it\nappears usually after the rain when theSun is low in the sky. The rainbow is\nReprint 2024-25\n\nLIGHT 135\nseen as a large arc in the sky with many\ncolours (Fig. 11.28).\nHow many colours are present in a\nrainbow? When observed carefully, thereare seven colours in a rainbow, though\nit may not be easy to distinguish all of\nthem. These are \u2014 red, orange, yellow,green, blue, indigo and violet.\nPaheli wants to tell you\nthat you can see a\nrainbow only when your\nback is towards the sun.\nYou  might have seen that when you\nblow soap bubbles, they appearcolourful. Similarly, when light is\nreflected from the surface of a\nCompact Disk (CD), you see manycolours (Fig. 11.29).\nOn the basis of these experiences,\ncould we say that the sunlight is amixture of different colours? Let us\ninvestigate.\nActivity 11.11\nTake a glass prism. Allow a narrow beam\nof sunlight through a small hole in thewindow of a dark room to fall on one\nface of the prism. Let the light coming\nout of the other face of the prism fall on\nDoes this mean that the\nwhite light consists of\nseven colours?\nFig. 11.28  A rainbow\nFig. 11.29  A CD placed in sun\nFig. 11.30  A prism splits a beam of sunlight into seven\ncolours\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 136Fig. 11.31  (a) A disc with seven colours (b) It appears white on rotating\na white sheet of paper or on a white wall.\nWhat do you observe? Do you see colours\nsimilar to those in a rainbow\n(Fig. 11.30)? This shows that the\nsunlight consists of seven colours. Thesunlight is said to be white light. This\nmeans that the white light consists of\nseven colours. Try to identify thesecolours and write their names in your\nnotebook.\nCan we mix these colours to get white\nlight? Let us try.\nActivity 11.12\nTake a circular cardboard disc of about10 cm diameter. Divide this disc intoseven segments. Paint the sevenrainbow colours on these segmentsas shown in Fig. 11.31 (a). You canalso paste, coloured papers onthese segments. Make a small hole\nat the centre of the disc. Fix the\ndisc loosely on the tip of a refill of aball pen. Ensure that the disc rotatesfreely [Fig. 11.31 (a)]. Rotate the discin the daylight. When the disc isrotated fast, the colours get mixed\ntogether and the disc appears\nto be whitish [Fig. 11.31 (b)]. Sucha disc is popularly known as Newton\u2019sdisc.\nPaheli has a brilliant idea! She\nhas prepared a small top with\na small circular disc with\nseven rainbow colourspainted on it (Fig. 11.32).\nWhen the top rotates it\nappears nearly white.\nFig. 11.32  A top with seven colours\nReprint 2024-25\n\nLIGHT 137\nKeywords\nMagnified image\nMagnifying glassPrism\nRainbow\nReal imageRear view mirrorSide mirror\nSpherical mirror\nVirtual image\nWhat you have learnt\n\uf06eLight travels along straight lines.\n\uf06eAny polished or a shining surface acts as a mirror.\n\uf06eAn image which can be obtained on a screen is called a real image.\n\uf06eAn image which cannot be obtained on a screen is called a virtual image.\n\uf06eThe image formed by a plane mirror is erect.

This principle marks adeparture from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system\nand causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and\ntextbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic\nidea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\nboundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take ussignificantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined\nin the National Policy on Education (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and\nteachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to\npursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space,\ntime and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the\ninformation passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as thesole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites\nof learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we\nperceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed\nbody of knowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of\nfunctioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour inimplementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days\nare actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation\nwill also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children\u2019s life at\nschool a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus\ndesigners have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring\nand reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for childpsychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance\nthis endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for\ncontemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring\nhands-on experience.\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates\nthe hard work done by the Textbook Development Committee responsible for thisbook. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in Science and\nMathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book,\nProf. V.B. Bhatia for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed\nto the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making\nthis possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have\ngenerously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel.We are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee,\nReprint 2024-25\n\nappointed by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of\nHuman Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri\nand Professor G.P. Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As an\norganisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the\nquality of its products, the NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will\nenable us to undertake further revision and refinement.\nDirector\nNew Delhi National Council of Educational20 November 2006 Research and Trainingiv\nReprint 2024-25\n\nRATIONALISATION OF CONTENT\nIN THE TEXTBOOKS\nIn view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load\non students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducingthe content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with\ncreative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the\nexercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomesalready developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken intoconsideration in this exercise.\nContents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in\nthe same class\n\u2022 Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same\nsubject\n\u2022 Difficulty level\n\u2022 Content, which is easily accessible to students without much\ninterventions from teachers and can be learned by children through\nself-learning or peer-learning\n\u2022 Content, which is irrelevant in the present context\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out\nthe changes given above.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nBlank\nReprint 2024-25\n\nPREFACE\nThis book is the outcome of the efforts of the Textbook Development Committee appointed\nby the NCERT. The committee met a few times to interact with one another to improve the\ndraft. Then there was a review meeting in which many experts and practicing schoolteachers were invited to review the draft and suggest improvements.\nBy and large we have stuck to the format of the Class VI book. By now, famous\ncharacters, Boojho and Paheli, have been used to make the text interactive. Attempt has\nbeen made to recall children\u2019s own experiences and build concepts around them. This is\ndesigned to connect science that they study in the school with their every-day life.\nMany activities have been suggested to clarify concepts. Some of these activities are so\nsimple that children can perform them on their own. The requirement of the apparatusrequired for the activities is minimal. We performed all the activities ourselves to ensure\nthat there was no difficulty in performing them in the school situation. The activities should\nalso help children in developing skills such as presentation of data in tabular and\ngraphical forms, reasoning and drawing inference from the given data.\nThe language of the book has been kept as simple as possible. A large number of\nphotographs, illustrations, cartoons, etc. have been included to make the book attractive.To help teachers evaluate children effectively, a large number of exercises have been given\nat the end of each chapter. The teachers are encouraged to frame additional exercises to\ntest children\u2019s understanding. Some challenging exercises have also been devised for those\nchildren who would like to appear for the National Talent Search Examination conductedby the NCERT.\nWe are conscious of the fact that there is a paucity of additional reading material for\nchildren. We have tried to address this problem by providing non-evaluative  boxes . These\nboxes, in blue, contain additional information, anecdotes, stories, strange facts and othersuch interesting materials.\nWe all know that children are mischievous and playful by nature. Therefore, in order to\nprevent any untoward incident during the performance of the activities in the school oroutside, necessary cautions, in red, have been inserted at various places in the book.\nTo prepare children to assume their roles as responsible citizens of tomorrow, attempt\nhas been made to sensitise them to the issues concerning gender, religion, environment,\nhealth and hygiene, water scarcity and energy conservation. We have sought to weave into\nthe text the value of cooperation and the importance of peer learning.\nAn important feature of the book is what we call \u2018Extended Learning\u2019 . These are totally\nnon-evaluative, and purely voluntary activities and projects. Some of the projects in thissection have been designed to enhance children\u2019s interaction with the experts, teachers,\neven parents, and society at large. The children are required to collect information of\nvarious kind and draw conclusions of their own.\nMy request to teachers and parents is to use the book in the spirit in which it has been\nwritten. Encourage children to perform activities and learn by doing, rather than by rote.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nYou can supplement, or even replace, the activities given here. If you feel that you have\nbetter alternatives, especially with your local/regional flavour, please write to us so that\nthese activities could be used in the future editions of the book.\nWe have been able to include only a small subset of children\u2019s experiences. You have a\nbetter knowledge of their experiences because you are in touch with them. Use them to\nillustrate the concepts being taught. Above all, please do not stifle children\u2019s natural\ncuriosity. Encourage them to ask questions, even if sometimes you feel uncomfortable. If\nyou do not know the answer to a question on the spot, do not feel embarrassed. You canpromise them to find the answer and deal with it later. Make a genuine attempt to get the\nanswer from whatever resources are within your reach, such as senior school or college\nteachers, experts, libraries, internet, etc. If, in spite of your efforts, you cannot get the\nanswer to some question, you could write to NCERT.\nI must thank the NCERT for enabling us to talk to children through the medium of this\nbook. Every member of the NCERT has been courteous and helpful to us. If you find thisbook useful and enjoy teaching/learning science through this book, the Editing Team and\nI shall consider ourselves well-rewarded.\nV.B.

They love to ask questions.\nAll kind of questions come to theirminds and they collect them in theirsacks. Sometimes, they may share\nsome of these questions with you, as\nyou read through the chapters.\nPaheli and Boojho are also on the\nlookout for answers to many\nquestions \u2014 sometimes the questions\nseem answered after they discussthem with each other, sometimesthrough discussions with other\nclassmates, teachers or their parents.\nAnswers to some questions do notseem available even after all these. They might need to experiment on their own,read books in the library, send questions to scientists. Just dig and dig and dig\ninto all possibilities and see if the questions can be answered. Perhaps, they\nwould carry some of the unanswered questions in their sacks to higher classes.\nWhat will really thrill them would be your adding questions to their sacks  or\nanswers to their questions. Sometimes, activities are suggested in the textbook,\nresults or findings of these by different groups of students would be of interest to\nother students and teachers. You can complete the suggested activities and sendyour results or findings to Paheli and Boojho.

We wear woollen\nclothes during winters when it is cold\noutside. Woollen clothes keep us warm.\nWe prefer to wear light coloured cottonclothes when it is hot. These give us a\nfeeling of coolness. You might have\nwondered why particular types ofclothes are suitable for a particular\nseason.\nIn winter you feel cold inside the\nhouse. If you come out in the sun, youfeel warm. In summer, you feel hot even\ninside the house. How do we knowwhether an object is hot or cold? How\ndo we find out how hot or cold an object\nis? In this chapter we shall try to seekanswers to some of these questions.\n3.1  H OT AND COLD\nIn our day-to-day life, we come across a\nnumber of objects. Some of them are hotWe see that some objects are cold\nwhile some are hot. You also know that\nsome objects are hotter than others\nwhile some are colder than others.  How\ndo we decide which object is hotter thanthe other? We often do it by touching\nthe objects. But is our sense of touch\nreliable? Let us find out.\nActivity 3.1\nTake three small tubs/containers. Labelthem as A, B and C. Put cold water in\ncontainer A and hot water in container\nTable 3.1:  Hot and cold objects\nObject Cold/Cool Warm/Hot\nIce cream \uf0d6\nSpoon in a\ntea cup\nFruit juiceHandle of a\nfrying pan\nFig. 3.1   Feeling water in three containers(A) (B) (C)and some of them are cold.

Be careful while handling a\ncandle flame or a stove.\nMake sure that water is not so hot thatyou burn your hand\nReprint 2024-25\n\nHEAT 25your hand and examine it carefully. If\nyou do not have a thermometer, request\na friend to share it with you. A clinical\nthermometer looks like the one shownin Fig. 3.2.\nA clinical thermometer consists of a\nlong, narrow, uniform glass tube. It hasa bulb at one end. This bulb contains\nmercury. Outside the bulb, a small\nshining thread of mercury can be seen.\nIf you do not see the mercury thread,\nrotate the thermometer a bit till you seeit.  You will also find a scale on thethermometer. The scale we use is the\ncelsius scale, indicated by \u00b0C.Boojho\u2019s confusion shows that we\ncannot always rely on our sense of touchto decide whether an object\nis hot or cold. Sometimesit may deceive us.\nThen, how do we find\nout how hot an object reallyis? A reliable measure of the\nhotness of an object is its\ntemperature . Temperature is\nmeasured by a device called\nthermometer .\n3.2 M EASURING  TEMPERATURE\nHave you seen a thermometer? Recall\nthat when you or someone else in yourfamily had fever, the temperature was\nmeasured by a thermometer. The\nthermometer that measures our bodytemperature is called a clinical\nthermometer . Hold the thermometer inFig. 3.2  A clinical thermom-\neter\nA clinical thermometer reads\ntemperature from 35\u00b0C to 42\u00b0C.\nActivity 3.2\nReading a thermometer\nLet us learn how to read a thermometer.\nFirst, note the temperature differenceindicated between the two bigger marks.\nAlso note down the number of divisionsB. Mix some cold and hot water in\ncontainer C.  Now dip your left hand in\ncontainer A and the right hand in\ncontainer B. After keeping the hands inthe two containers for 2\u20133 minutes, put\nboth the hands simultaneously in\ncontainer C (Fig. 3.1).  Do both thehands get the same feeling?\nBoojho wondered which of the two scales\nshown in Fig. 3.2 he should read.  Paheli told\nhim that India has adopted the celsius scale\nand we should read that scale.  The other scale\nwith the range 94\u2013108 degrees is the\nFahrenheit scale (\u00b0F). It was in use earlier.\nBoojho says,\u201cMy left hand\ntells me that the water in mug\nC is hot and the right hand\ntells me that the same water\nis cold.  What should I\nconclude?\u201d\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 26\nPrecautions to be observed while using a clinical thermometer\n\uf0a7Thermometer should be washed before and after use, preferably with an\nantiseptic solution.\n\uf0a7Ensure that before use the mercury level is below 35\u00b0C.\n\uf0a7Read the thermometer keeping the level of mercury along the line of sight.(See Fig. 3.3).\n\uf0a7Handle the thermometer with care. If it hits against some hard object, it can\nbreak.\n\uf0a7Don\u2019t hold the thermometer by the bulb while reading it.\n(shown by smaller marks) between thesemarks.  Suppose the bigger marks read\none degree and there are five divisionsbetween them.  Then, one small division\ncan read \n10.2 C5\uf03d\uf0b0 .\nWash the thermometer, preferably\nwith an antiseptic solution. Hold it\nfirmly and give it a few jerks. The jerks\nwill bring the level of mercury down.Ensure that it falls below 35\u00b0C.  Now\nplace the bulb of the thermometer\nFig. 3.3  Correct method of reading a clinical\nthermometerunder your tongue. After one minute,\ntake the thermometer out and note thereading.  This is your body temperature.\nThe temperature should always be\nstated with its unit, \u00b0C.\nWhat did you record as your body\ntemperature?\nThe normal temperature of human\nbody is 37\u00b0C. Note that the temperature\nis stated with its unit.\nLet us try to assure Paheli that there\nis nothing wrong with her.\nActivity 3.3\nMeasure the body temperature of someof your friends (at least 10) with a\nTable 3.2: Body temperature of\nsome persons\nName Temperature (\u00b0C)\nPaheli measured her body\ntemperature. She got worried as\nit was not exactly 37\u00b0C.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nHEAT 27\nclinical thermometer. Record your\nobservations as in Table 3.2.\nIs the body temperature of every\nperson 37\u00b0C?\nThe temperature of every person may\nnot be 37\u00b0C.  It could be slightly higher\nor slightly lower.  Actually, what we call\nnormal temperature is the average bodytemperature of a large number of healthy\npersons.\nThe clinical thermometer is designed\nto measure the temperature of humanbody only.  The temperature of human\nbody normally does not go below 35\noC\nor above 42oC. That is the reason\nthat this thermometer has the range35\noC to 42oC.Different types of thermometersare used for different purposes.The maximum and minimum\ntemperatures of the previous\nday, reported in weatherreports, are measured by a\nthermometer called the\nmaximum -minimum\nthermometer.\nCAUTION\nDo not use a clinical thermometer formeasuring the temperature of any\nobject other than the human body.\nAlso avoid keeping the thermometer inthe sun or near a flame. It may break.this thermometer.  Look at itcarefully and note the highest and\nthe lowest temperature it can\nmeasure. The range of alaboratory thermometer is\ngenerally from \u201310\u00b0C to 110\u00b0C\n(Fig. 3.4). Also, as you did in thecase of the clinical thermometer,\nfind out how much a small\ndivision on this thermometerreads.  You would need this\ninformation to read the\nthermometer correctly.\nLet us now learn how this\nthermometer is used.\nActivity 3.4\nTake some tap water in a beaker\nor a mug.  Dip the thermometer\nin water so that the bulb isimmersed in water but does not\ntouch the bottom or the sides of\nthe container. Hold thethermometer vertically (Fig. 3.5).\nObserve the movement of mercury\nin the thermometer.  Wait till themercury thread becomes steady.\nFig. 3.4   A laboratory thermometer3.3 L ABORATORY  THERMOMETER\nHow do we measure the temperature ofother objects? For this purpose, thereare other thermometers. One such\nthermometer is known as the laboratory\nthermometer.  The teacher will show you\nBoojho got a naughty idea.  He\nwanted to measure the temperature\nof hot milk using a clinical\nthermometer.  Paheli stopped him\nfrom doing so.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 28Are there any variations in the\nreadings? Discuss the possible reasons.\nLet us try to answer this question.\nActivity 3.5\nTake some hot water in a beaker or amug.  Dip the thermometer in water.\nWait till the mercury thread becomessteady and note the temperature.  Now\ntake out the thermometer from water.\nObserve carefully what happens now.Do you notice that as soon as you take\nthe thermometer out of water, the level\nof mercury begins to fall.  This meansthat the temperature must be read while\nthe thermometer is in water.\nYou may recall that while taking your\nown temperature, you have to take thethermometer out of your mouth to note\nthe reading. Can you then use thelaboratory thermometer to measure yourIn addition to the precautions to be taken while reading a clinical\nthermometer, the laboratory thermometer\n\uf0a7should be kept upright not tilted. (Fig. 3.5)\n\uf0a7bulb should be surrounded from all sides by the substance of which the\ntemperature is to be measured. The bulb should not touch the surface of the\ncontainer.\nFig. 3.5  Measuring temperature of water with a\nlaboratory thermometer\nBoojho now understands why\nclinical thermometer cannot be\nused to measure high\ntemperatures. But still wonders\nwhether a laboratory thermometer\ncan be used to measure his body\ntemperature.\nNote the reading. This is the temperature\nof water at that time.\nCompare the temperature of water\nrecorded by each student in the class.\nBoojho wonders why the level\nof mercury should change at\nall when the bulb of the\nthermometer is brought in contact\nwith another object?\nReprint 2024-25\n\nHEAT 29\nbody temperature?  Obviously, it is not\nconvenient to use the laboratorythermometer for this purpose.\nWhy does the mercury not fall or rise\nin a clinical thermometer when takenout of the mouth?\nObserve a clinical thermometer\nagain. Do you see a kink near the bulb(Fig. 3.6).\nWhat is the use of the kink? It\nprevents mercury level from falling onits own.in all cases heat flows from a hotterobject to a colder object.\nHow does heat flow?  Let us\ninvestigate.\nActivity 3.6\nTake a rod or flat strip of a metal, say ofaluminium or iron.  Fix a few small waxpieces on the rod.  These pieces should\nbe at nearly equal distances (Fig. 3.7).\nClamp the rod to a stand. If you do notfind a stand, you can   put one end of\nthe rod in between bricks.  Now, heat\nthe other end of the rod and observe.\nWhat happens to the wax pieces?  Do\nthese pieces begin to fall? Which piecefalls the first? Do you think that heat isFig. 3.6  A clinical thermometer has a kink in it\n3.4 T RANSFER  OF HEAT\nYou might have observed that a frying\npan becomes hot when kept on a flame.\nIt is because the heat passes from theflame to the utensil. When the pan is\nremoved from the fire, it slowly cools\ndown.  Why does it cool down?  The heatis transferred from the pan to the\nsurroundings.  So you can understand\nthat in both cases, the heat flows froma hotter object to a colder object. In fact,\nPaheli asks: \u201cDoes it mean\nthat heat will not be\ntransferred if the temperature of\ntwo objects is the same?\u201d\ntransferred from the end nearest to theflame to the other end?\nThe process by which heat is\ntransferred from the hotter end to thecolder end of an object is known asconduction . In solids, generally, theFig. 3.7  Flow of heat through a metal stripThere is a lot of concern over\nthe use of mercury in\nthermometers. Mercury is atoxic substance and is very\ndifficult to dispose of if a\nthermometer breaks. Thesedays, digital thermometers\nare available which do not\nuse mercury.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 30heat is transferred by the process of\nconduction.\nDo all substances conduct heat\neasily?   You must have observed thatthe metallic pan for cooking has a plasticor wooden handle.  Can you lift a hot\npan by holding it from the handle\nwithout getting hurt?\nActivity 3.7\nHeat water in a small pan or a beaker.Collect some articles such as a steel\nspoon, plastic scale, pencil and divider.\nDip one end of each of these articles inhot water (Fig. 3.8). Wait for a fewminutes. Touch the other end. Enteryour observation in Table 3.3.\nThe materials which allow heat to\npass through them easily areconductors  of heat. For examples,\naluminum, iron and copper. The\nmaterials which do not allow heat to\npass through them easily are poorconductors of heat such as plastic and\nwood. Poor conductors are known as\ninsulators .\nThe water and air are poor\nconductors of heat. Then, how does theheat transfer take place in thesesubstances?  Let us find out.\nActivity 3.8\nTake a  round bottom flask (if flask is\nnot available, a beaker can be used).  Fillit two-thirds with water. Place it on atripod, or make some arrangement to\nplace the flask in such a way that you\ncan heat it by placing a candle below it.Wait till the water in the flask is\nstill. Place a crystal of potassium\npermanganate at the bottom of the flaskgently using a straw. Now, heat the water\nby placing the candle just below the\ncrystal.\nWrite your observation in your\nnotebook and also draw a picture of\nwhat you observe (Fig. 3.9).\nWhen water is heated,\nthe water near the flame getshot.  Hot water rises up.The cold water from the\nsides moves down towards\nthe source of heat. Thiswater also gets hot and risesFig. 3.8  Conduction of heat by different\nmaterials\nTable 3.3\nArticle Material with Does the other\nwhich the article end get hot\nis made of Yes/No\nSteel spoon Metal Yes\nReprint 2024-25\n\nHEAT 31\nNotice that towards the top, the air\ngets heated by convection. Therefore, the\nhand above the flame feels hot. On thesides, however, there is no convection\nand air does not feel as hot as at\nthe top.\n The people living in the coastal areas\nexperience an interesting phenomenon.During the day, the land gets heatedfaster than the water. The air over the\nland becomes hotter and rises up. The\ncooler air from the sea rushes in towardsthe land to take its place. The warm air\nfrom the land moves towards the sea to\ncomplete the cycle (Fig. 3.11). The airfrom the sea is called the sea breeze . To\nreceive the cooler sea breeze, the windowsof the houses in coastal areas are madeto face the sea.  At night it is exactly the\nreverse. The water cools down more\nslowly than the land. So, the cool airfrom the land moves towards the sea.\nThis is called  the land breeze .\nWhen we come out in the sun, we\nfeel warm. How does the heat from thesun reach us? It cannot reach us by\nconduction or convection as there is nomedium such as air in most part of the\nspace between the earth and the sun.and water from the sides moves down.\nThis process continues till the whole\nwater gets heated. This mode of heat\ntransfer is known as convection.\nHow does the heat travel in air?  In\nwhich direction does the smoke go?\nThe air near the heat source gets hot\nand rises.  The air from the sides comes\nin to take its place. In this way the air\ngets heated. The following activityconfirms this idea.\nActivity 3.9\nLight a candle. Keep one hand above the\nflame and one hand on the side of the\nflame  (Fig. 3.10). Do your hands feelequally hot?  If not which hand feels\nhotter?  And why?Fig. 3.10  Transfer of heat by convection in air\nFig. 3.9  Convection of heat in water\nBe careful.  Keep your hands at a safedistance from the flame so that they\ndo not get burnt.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 32From the sun the heat comes to us by\nanother process known as radiation .\nThe transfer of heat by radiation doesnot require any medium. It can takeplace whether a medium is present or\nnot. When we sit in front of a room\nheater, we get heat by this process. Ahot utensil kept away from the flame\ncools down as it transfers heat to the\nsurroundings by radiation. Our bodytoo, gives heat to the surroundings and\nreceives heat from it by radiation.\nAll hot bodies radiate heat.  When\nthis heat falls on some object, a part ofit is reflected, a part is absorbed and a\npart may be transmitted. Thetemperature of the object increases due\nto the absorbed part of the heat. Whyare you advised to use an umbrella when\nyou go out in the sun?\n3.5 K INDS OF CLOTHES  WE WEAR IN\nSUMMER  AND WINTER\nYou know that in summer we prefer\nlight-coloured clothes and in winter we\nusually wear dark-coloured clothes. Whyis it so? Let us find out\nActivity 3.10\nTake two identical tin cans.  Paint theouter surface of one black and of the\nother white (Fig. 3.12).

In\nFig. 3.11  Sea breeze and Land  breezeDay time Night time\nHot\nCoolCoolHot\nReprint 2024-25\n\nHEAT 33\nWe often use electricity and fuels like coal and wood to keep our houses cool or\nwarm. Is it possible to construct buildings, that are not affected much by heatand cold outside? This can be done by constructing outer walls of buildings so\nthat they have trapped layers of air. One way of doing this is to use hollow\nbricks, which are available these days.\nwhich can is the water warmer?  Youcan feel the difference even by touchingwater in the two cans.\nActivity 3.11\nFill the two cans used in Activity 3.10\nwith the same amount of hot water at\nthe same temperature (say, at 60oC).\nLeave the cans in a room or in a shade.\nNote the temperature of water after\n10\u201315 minutes.  Does the temperature\nof water in both the cans fall by the same\namount?\nDo these activities suggest to you the\nreason why it is more comfortable towear white or light-coloured clothes inthe summer and dark-coloured clothes\nin the winter? Dark surfaces absorb\nmore heat and, therefore, we feel\ncomfortable with dark coloured clothes\nin the winter. Light coloured clothes\nreflect most of the heat that falls on them\nand, therefore, we feel more comfortable\nwearing them in the summer.\nWoollen clothes keep us warm\nin winter\nIn the winter, we use woollen clothes.\nWool is a poor conductor of heat.\nMoreover, there is air trapped in betweenthe wool fibres. This air prevents the flowof heat from our body to the coldsurroundings. So, we feel warm.\nSuppose you are given the choice in\nwinter of using either one thick blanketor two thin blankets joined together.What would you choose and why?Remember that there would be a layerof air in between the blankets.Fig. 3.12  Containers with black and white\nsurface\nKeywords\nCelsius scale\nConductionConductor\nConvectionInsulator\nLand breezeRadiationSea breeze\nTemperatureThermometer\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 34\nWhat you have learnt\n\uf06eOur sense of touch is not always a reliable guide to the degree of hotness\nof an object.\n\uf06eTemperature is a measure of the degree of hotness of an object.\n\uf06eThermometer is a device used for measuring temperature.\n\uf06eClinical thermometer is used to measure our body temperature.

            "text": "Respiration in\nOrganisms6\nOne day Boojho was eagerly\nwaiting to meet his\ngrandparents who were coming\nto the town after a year. He was in a real\nhurry as he wanted to receive them at the\nbus-stop. He ran fast and reached the\nbus-stop in a few minutes. He wasbreathing rapidly. His grandmother asked\nhim why he was breathing so fast. Boojho\ntold her that he came running all the way.But the question got stuck in his mind.\nHe wondered why running makes a\nperson breathe faster. The answer toBoojho\u2019s question lies in understanding\nwhy we breathe. Breathing is a part of\nrespiration. Let us learn about respiration.\n6.1 W HY DO WE RESPIRE ?\nIn Chapter 2 you learnt that all\norganisms are made of small\nmicroscopic units called cells. A cell isthe smallest structural and functional\nunit of an organism. Each cell of an\norganism performs certain functionssuch as nutrition, transport, excretion\nand reproduction. To perform these\nfunctions, the cell needs energy. Evenwhen we are eating, sleeping or reading\nwe require energy. But, where does this\nenergy come from? Can you say whyyour parents insist that you should eat\nregularly? The food has stored energy,\nwhich is released during respiration.Therefore, all living organisms respireto get energy from food. During\nbreathing, we breathe in air. You know\nthat air contains oxygen. We breathe outair which is rich in carbon dioxide. The\nair we breathe in is transported to all\nparts of the body and ultimately to eachcell. In  the cells, oxygen in the air helps\nin the breakdown of food. The process\nof breakdown of food in the cell with therelease of energy is called cellular\nrespiration. Cellular respiration takesplace in the  cells of all organisms.\nIn the cell, the food (glucose) is broken\ndown into carbon dioxide and water usingoxygen. When breakdown of glucoseoccurs with the use of oxygen it is called\naerobic  respiration . Food can also be\nbroken down, without using oxygen. This\nis called anaerobic respiration .\nBreakdown of food releases energy.\nYou should know that there are some\norganisms such as yeast that can survivein the absence of air. They are calledanaerobes . They get energy through\nanaerobic respiration. In the absence ofoxygen, glucose breaks down into alcoholand carbon dioxide, as given below:\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 58\nOur muscle cells can also respire\nanaerobically, but only for a short time,\nwhen there is a temporary deficiency of\noxygen. During heavy exercise, fast\nrunning (Fig. 6.1), cycling, walking formany hours or heavy weight lifting, the\ndemand for energy is high. But the\nsupply of oxygen to produce the energyis limited. Then anaerobic respiration\ntakes places in the muscle cells to fulfil\nthe demand of energy:\nFig. 6.1  During exercise, some muscles may\nrespire anaerobicallyHave you ever wondered why you get\nmuscle cramps after heavy exercise? Thecramps occur when muscle cells respire\nanaerobically. The partial breakdown of\nglucose produces lactic acid. Theaccumulation of lactic acid  causes muscle\ncramps. We get relief from cramps after ahot water bath or a massage. Can youguess why it is so? Hot water bath or\nmassage improves circulation of blood.\nAs a result, the supply of oxygen to themuscle cells increases. The increase in\nthe supply of oxygen results in the\ncomplete breakdown of lactic acid intocarbon dioxide and water.\n6.2 B REATHING\nActivity 6.1Yeasts are single-celled organisms.They respire anaerobically and during\nthis process yield alcohol. They are,\ntherefore, used to make wine and beer.\nCAUTION\nDo this activity under the supervision\nof your teacher.\nClose your nostrils and mouth\ntightly and look at a watch.

How long were\nyou able to keep both of them closed?\nNote down the time for which you couldhold your breath (Fig. 6.2).\nSo, now you know that you cannot\nsurvive for long without breathing.\n Breathing means taking in air rich\nin oxygen and giving out air rich incarbon dioxide with the help ofrespiratory organs. The taking in of air\nrich in oxygen\n into the body is called\ninhalation and giving out of air rich in\ncarbon dioxide is known as exhalation.\nIt is a continuous process which goes\nReprint 2024-25\n\nRESPIRATION  IN ORGANISMS 59\nyou like to find out your breathing rate?\nDo you want to know whether it isconstant or it changes according to the\nrequirement of oxygen by the body?

Can you say in which activity, the\nrate of breathing will be the slowest and\nin which it will be the fastest? Assignnumbers to the pictures in the order of\nincreasing rate of breathing according\nto your experience.\n6.3 H OW DO WE BREATHE ?\nLet us now learn about the mechanismof breathing. Normally we take in air\nthrough our nostrils. When we inhale\nair, it passes through our nostrils intothe nasal cavity . From the nasal cavity,\nthe air reaches our lungs through the\nwindpipe. Lungs are present in thechest cavity (Fig. 6.4). This cavity is\nsurrounded by ribs on the sides. A large,muscular sheet called diaphragm  forms\nthe floor of the chest cavity (Fig. 6.4).\nBreathing involves the movement of the\ndiaphragm and the rib cage.\nDuring inhalation, ribs move up and\noutwards and diaphragm moves down.This movement increases space in ourchest cavity and air rushes into the\nlungs. The lungs get filled with air.\nDuring exhalation, ribs move down andinwards, while diaphragm moves up to\nits former position. This reduces the size\nof the chest cavity and air is pushed outof the lungs (Fig. 6.5). These movements\nin our body can be felt easily. Take aOn an average, an adult human being\nat rest breathes in and out 15\u201318times in a minute. During heavy\nexercise, the breathing rate can\nincrease upto 25 times per minute.While we exercise, not only do we\nbreathe fast, we also take deep breaths\nand thus inhale more oxygen.\nPaheli wants to know why\nwe yawn when we are\nsleepy or drowsy.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nRESPIRATION  IN ORGANISMS 61deep breath.

However, sometimes these particles may get past the hair in the\nnasal cavity. This may irritate the lining of the cavity, as a result of which we\nsneeze. Sneezing expels these foreign particles from the inhaled air and a dust-free, clean air enters our body.\nTAKE CARE: When you sneeze, you should cover your nose so that the foreign\nparticles you expel are not inhaled by other persons.Smoking damages lungs.

The production\nof new individuals from their parents is\nknown as reproduction. But, how do\nplants reproduce? There are different\nmodes of reproduction in plants which\nwe shall learn in this chapter.\n8.1 M ODES OF REPRODUCTION\nIn Class VI you learnt about different\nparts of a flowering plant. Try to list thevarious parts of a plant and write the\nfunctions of each. Most plants have\nroots, stems and leaves. These are calledthe vegetative parts  of a plant. After a\ncertain period of growth, most plantsbear flowers. You may have seen themango trees flowering in spring. It is\nthese flowers that give rise to juicy\nmango fruit we enjoy in summer. We eat\nthe fruits and usually discard the seeds.\nSeeds germinate and form new plants.\nSo, what is the function of flowers in\nplants? Flowers perform the function of\nreproduction in plants. Flowers are the\nreproductive parts .\nThere are several ways by which\nplants produce their offspring. These are\ncategorised into two types: (i) asexual,\nand (ii) sexual reproduction. In asexual\nreproduction  plants can give rise to new\nplants without seeds, whereas in sexualAsexual reproduction\nIn asexual reproduction new plants are\nobtained without production of seeds.\nVegetative propagation\nIt is a type of asexual reproduction in\nwhich new plants are produced fromroots, stems, leaves and buds. Since\nreproduction is through the vegetative\nparts of the plant, it is known asvegetative propagation.\nActivity 8.1\nCut a branch of rose or champa with a\nnode. This piece of branch is termed a\ncutting. Bury the cutting in the soil. Anode is a part of the stem/branch at\nwhich a leaf arises (Fig. 8.1). Water the\ncutting every day and observe itsgrowth.

Apart fromflower buds, there are buds in the axil(point of attachment of the leaf at the\nnode) of leaves which develop into\nshoots. These buds are called vegetativebuds (Fig. 8.2). A bud consists of a short\nstem around which immature\noverlapping leaves are present. Vegetative\nbuds can also give rise to new plants.\nActivity 8.2\nTake a fresh potato. Observe the scars\non it with the help of a magnifying glass.\nYou may find bud(s) in them. These scarsare also called \u201ceyes\u201d .

The new plantsare exact copies of the parent plant, as\nthey are produced from a single parent.\nLater in this chapter you will learn\nthat plants produced by sexualreproduction have characters of both the\nparents. Plants produce seeds as a resultof sexual reproduction.\nBudding\nYou have already learnt about the tiny\norganisms like yeast can be seen only\nunder a microscope. These grow andmultiply every few hours if sufficient\nnutrients are made available to them.\nRemember that yeast is a single-celledorganism. Let us see how they\nreproduce?The small bulb-like projection\ncoming out from the yeast cell is calleda bud. The bud gradually grows and\ngets detached from the parent cell and\nforms a new yeast cell. The new yeast\ncell grows, matures and produces more\nyeast cells. Sometimes, another  budarises from the bud forming a chain of\nbuds. If this process continues, a large\nnumber of yeast cells are produced in ashort time.\nFragmentation\nYou might have seen slimy green\npatches in ponds, or in other stagnant\nwater bodies. These are the algae. When\nFig. 8.5  Reproduction in yeast by buddingYeast cellDeveloping budChain of buds\nNew budNew plants\nReprint 2024-25\n\nREPRODUCTION  IN PLANTS 85\nair. As they are very light they can cover\nlong distances.\nSpores are asexual reproductive\nbodies. Each spore is covered by ahard protective coat to withstandunfavourable conditions such as high\ntemperature and low humidity. So\nthey can survive for a long time. Underfavourable conditions, a spore\ngerminates and develops into a new\nindividual. Plants such as moss andferns (Fig. 8.8) also reproduce by means\nof spores.\n12.2 S EXUAL REPRODUCTION\nYou have learnt earlier the structure ofa flower.

When the pollenof a flower lands on the stigma of a flower\nof a different plant of the same kind, it\nis called cross-pollination  [Fig. 8.10 (a)\nand (b)].\nFertilisation\nThe cell which results after fusion of\nthe gametes is called a zygote .

The zygote\ndevelops into an embryo.\n8.3 F RUITS AND SEED FORMATION\nAfter fertilisation, the ovary grows intoa fruit and other parts of the flower fall\noff. The fruit is the ripened ovary. The\nseeds develop from the ovules. The seedcontains an embryo enclosed in a\nprotective seed coat.\nSome fruits are fleshy and juicy such\nas mango and orange. Some fruits arehard like almonds and walnuts\n[Fig. 8.12 (a) and (b)].\n8.4 S EED DISPERSAL\nIn nature same kind of plants grow atdifferent places. This happens because\nseeds are dispersed to different places .\nSometimes after a walk through a forest\nor a field or a park, you may have found\nseeds or fruits sticking to your clothes.Fig. 8.11  Fertilisation (Zygote formation)\nPollen grain (germinating)\nOvumZygote\nformation\nPollen tube\n(a)(b)(a)\n(b)\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 88Did you try to observe how these seeds\nwere clinging to your clothes?\nWhat do you think will happen if all\nseeds of a plant were to fall at the sameplace and grow there? There would besevere competition for sunlight, water,\nminerals and space. As a result the seeds\nwould not grow into healthy plants.Plants benefit by seed dispersal. It\nprevents competition between the plant\nand its own seedlings for sunlight, waterand minerals. It also enables the plants\nto invade new habitats for wider\ndistribution.\nSeeds and fruits of plants are carried\naway by wind, water and animals.Winged seeds such as those of drumstickand maple [Fig. 8.13 (a) and (b)], lightseeds of grasses or hairy seeds of aak(Madar ) and hairy fruit of sunflower\n[Fig. 8.14 (a), (b)], get blown off with the\nwind to far away places. Some seeds are\ndispersed by water. These fruits or seedsusually develop floating ability in the\nform of spongy or fibrous outer coat as\nin coconut. Some seeds are dispersed byanimals, especially spiny seeds with\nhooks which get attached to the bodies\nof animals and are carried to distantplaces. Examples are Xanthium\n(Fig. 8.15) and Urena .\nSome seeds are dispersed when the\nfruits burst with sudden jerks. The seeds\nare scattered far from the parent plant.\nThis happens in the case of castor andbalsam.\nFig. 8.13  Seeds of (a) drumstick and\n(b) maple\nFig. 8.15  XanthiumFig. 8.14  (a) The hairy fruit of sunflower and\n(b) hairy seed of madar (aak)\nSeed\nWing\n(a) (b) (a) (b)\nReprint 2024-25\n\nREPRODUCTION  IN PLANTS 89\nWhat you have learnt\n\uf06eAll organisms multiply or reproduce their own kind.\n\uf06eIn plants there are two modes of reproduction, asexual and sexual.\n\uf06eThere are several methods of asexual reproduction such as\nfragmentation, budding, spore formation and vegetative propagation.\n\uf06eSexual reproduction involves the fusion of male and female gametes.\n\uf06eIn vegetative propagation new plants are produced from differentvegetative parts such as leaves, stems and roots.\n\uf06eFlower is the reproductive part of a plant.\n\uf06eA flower may be unisexual with either the male or the female reproductiveparts.\n\uf06eA bisexual flower has both the male and the female reproductive parts.\n\uf06eThe male gametes are found inside the pollen grains and female gametesare found in the ovule.\n\uf06ePollination is the process of transfer of pollen grains from the anther ofone flower to the stigma of the same or another flower.\n\uf06ePollination is of two types, self-pollination and cross-pollination. Inself-pollination, pollen grains are transferred from the anther to thestigma of the same flower. In cross-pollination, pollen grains aretransferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flowerof the same kind.\n\uf06ePollination takes place in plants with the help of wind, water and insects.\n\uf06eThe fusion of male and female gametes is called fertilisation.\n\uf06eFertilised egg is called zygote. Zygote develops into an embryo.\n\uf06eFruit is the mature ovary whereas ovule develops into a seed, whichcontains the developing embryo.\n\uf06eSeed dispersal is aided by wind, water and animals.\n\uf06eSeed dispersal helps the plants to (i) prevent overcrowding, (ii) avoidcompetition for sunlight, water and minerals and (iii) invade new habitats.Keywords\nAsexual reproduction\nBuddingEmbryoFertilisationFragmentationGametesHyphaOvulePollen grainPollen tubePollinationSeed dispersalSexual reproductionSporeSporangiumVegetative propagationZygote\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 90Exercises\n1.

The stomach then goes back\ninto the body and the food is slowlydigested.\n2.2 D IGESTION  IN HUMANS\nWe take in food through the mouth,digest and utilise it. The unused partsof the food are defecated. Have you ever\nwondered what happens to the food\ninside the body? The food passesthrough a continuous canal (Fig. 2.2)\nwhich begins at the buccal cavity and\nends at the anus. The canal can bedivided into various compartments:\n(1) the buccal cavity, (2) foodpipe or\noesophagus , (3) stomach , (4) small\nintestine, (5) large intestine ending in\nthe rectum  and (6) the anus. Is it not a\nvery long path? These parts together\nform the alimentary canal  (digestive\ntract). The food components graduallyget digested as food travels through thevarious compartments. The inner wallsof the stomach and the small intestine,and the various glands associated with thecanal such as salivary glands , the liver\nand the pancreas secrete digestive juices.\nThe digestive juices convert complex\nsubstances of food into simpler ones. The\ndigestive tract and the associated glands\ntogether constitute the digestive system .\nNow, let us know what happens to\nthe food in different parts of the digestivetract.\nThe mouth and buccal cavity\nFood is taken into the body through themouth.

The first set of\nteeth grows during infancy and they fall off at the age between six to eightyears. These are termed milk teeth . The second set that replaces them are the\npermanent teeth . The permanent teeth may last throughout life or fall off\nduring old age or due to some dental disease.\nthe body is called ingestion . We chew\nthe food with the teeth and break itdown mechanically into small pieces.Each tooth is rooted in a separate socket\nin the gums (Fig. 2.3). Our teeth vary in\nappearance and perform differentfunctions. Accordingly they are given\ndifferent names (Fig. 2.3).\nActivity 2.2\nWash your hands. Look into the\nmirror and count your teeth.

However, if we do not clean our teeth and mouth after eating,\nmany harmful bacteria also begin to live and grow in it. These bacteriabreak down the sugars present from the leftover food and release\nacids (see Chapter 4 to know what an acid is). The acids gradually\ndamage the teeth (Fig. 2.5). This is called tooth decay . If it is not\ntreated in time, it causes severe toothache and in extreme cases\nresults in tooth loss. Chocolates, sweets, soft drinks and other sugar\nproducts are the major culprits of tooth decay.\nTherefore, one should clean the teeth with a brush or datun and\ndental floss (a special strong thread which is moved between twoteeth to take out trapped food particles) at least twice a day andrinse the mouth after every meal. Also, one should not put dirty\nfingers or any unwashed object in the mouth.\nFig. 2.5  Gradual decay of tooth(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nOur mouth has the salivary glands\nwhich secrete saliva.

Look at Fig. 2.2.\nThe foodpipe runs along the neckSometimes when you eat in a hurry, talk or laugh while eating, you may cough,\nget hiccups or a choking sensation. This happens when food particles enter thewindpipe. The windpipe carries air from the nostrils to the lungs. It runs adjacent\nto the foodpipe. But inside the throat, air and food share a common passage.\nThen how is food prevented from entering the windpipe? During the act ofswallowing a flap-like valve closes the passage of the windpipe and guides the\nfood into the foodpipe. If, by chance, food particles enter the windpipe, we feel\nchoked, get hiccups or cough.\nFood\nOesophagus\nStomach\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 16The working of the stomach was discovered by a\nstrange accident. In 1822, a man named Alexis St.\nMartin was badly hit by a shot gun. The bullet had\nseriously damaged the chest wall and made a holein his stomach. He was brought to an American\narmy doctor William Beaumont. The doctor saved\nthe patient but he could not close the hole properlyand left it bandaged (Fig. 2.8). Beaumont took it as\na great opportunity to see the inside of the stomach\nthrough the hole. He made some wonderfulobservations.\nBeaumont found that the stomach was churning\nfood. Its wall secreted a fluid which could digestthe food. He also observed that the end of the stomach opens into the intestine\nonly after the digestion of the food inside the stomach is completed.\nand the chest. Food is pushed down by\nmovement of the wall of the foodpipe.Actually this movement takes place\nthroughout the alimentary canal and\npushes the food downwards (Fig.  2.7).At times the food is not accepted by our\nstomach and is vomited out. Recall the\ninstances when you vomited after eatingand think of the reason for it. Discuss\nwith your parents and teacher.\nThe stomach\nThe stomach is a thick-walled bag. Itsshape is like a flattened J and it is the\nwidest part of the alimentary canal. Itreceives food from the food pipe at one\nend and opens into the small intestine\nat the other.\nThe inner lining of the stomach\nsecretes mucous, hydrochloric acid anddigestive juices. The mucous protectsthe lining of the stomach. The acid kills\nmany bacteria that enter along with thefood and makes the medium in the\nstomach acidic and helps the digestivejuices to act. The digestive juices break\ndown the proteins  into simpler\nsubstances.\nThe small intestine\nThe small intestine is highly coiled and\nis about 7.5 metres long. It receivessecretions from the liver and the pancreas.\nBesides, its wall also secretes juices.\nThe liver is a reddish brown gland\nsituated in the upper part of theabdomen on the right side. It is the\nlargest gland in the body. It secretes bile\njuice that is stored in a sac called the\ngall bladder (Fig. 2.2). The bile plays\nan important role in the digestion of fats.\nThe pancreas is a large cream\ncoloured gland located just below thestomach (Fig. 2.2). The pancreatic juiceacts on carbohydrates, fats and proteins\nand changes them into simpler forms.\nFig. 2.8  Alexis St. Martin\u2019s\nshotgun wound\nReprint 2024-25\n\nNUTRITION  IN ANIMALS 17Diarrhoea\nSometime you may have experienced the need to pass watery stool frequently.\nThis condition is known as diarrhoea. It may be caused by an infection, food\npoisoning or indigestion. It is very common in India, particularly among children.\nUnder severe conditions it can be fatal. This is because of the excessive loss of\nwater and salts from the body. Diarrhoea should not be neglected. Even before a\ndoctor is consulted the patient should be given plenty of boiled and cooled waterwith a pinch of salt and sugar dissolved in it. This is called Oral Rehydration\nSolution (ORS).The partly digested food now reaches thelower part of the small intestine wherethe intestinal juice completes the\ndigestion of all components of the food.\nThe carbohydrates get broken intosimple sugars such as glucose, fats into\nfatty acids and glycerol, and proteins\ninto amino acids.\nAbsorption in the small\nintestine\nThe digested food can now pass into the\nblood vessels in the wall of the intestine.This process is called absorption. The\ninner walls of the small intestine havethousands of finger-like outgrowths.These are called villi (singular villus).\nCan you guess what the role of villi couldbe in the intestine? The villi increasethe surface area for absorption of the\ndigested food. Each villus has a network\nof thin and small blood vessels close toits surface. The surface of the villi\nabsorbs the digested food materials. The\nabsorbed substances are transportedvia the blood vessels to different organs\nof the body where they are used to build\ncomplex substances such as theproteins required by the body. This is\ncalled assimilation . In the cells, glucose\nbreaks down with the help of oxygen\ninto carbon dioxide and water, and\nenergy is released. The food thatremains undigested and unabsorbed\nenters into the large intestine.\nLarge intestine\nThe large intestine is wider and shorterthan small intestine. It is about 1.5 metre\nin length. Its function is to absorb  waterand some salts from the undigested food\nmaterial. The remaining waste passes\ninto the rectum and remains there assemi-solid faeces. The faecal matter is\nremoved through the anus from\ntime-to-time. This is called egestion.\n2.3 D IGESTION  IN GRASS-EATING\nANIMALS\nHave you observed cows, buffaloesand other grass-eating animals\nchewing continuously even when\nthey are not eating?

Many\nanimals, including humans, cannotdigest cellulose.\nAnimals like horses, rabbit, etc., have\na large sac-like structure called Caecum\nbetween the oesophagus and the small\nintestine (Fig. 2.9). The cellulose of the\nfood is digested here by the action of\ncertain bacteria which are not present in\nhumans.\nSo far you have learnt about animals\nwhich possess the digestive system. Butthere are many small organisms which do\nnot have a mouth and a digestive system.Then, how do they acquire and digest\nfood? In the section below you will learn\nanother interesting way of food intake.\n2.4 F EEDING  AND DIGESTION  IN\nAMOEBA\nAmoeba is a microscopic single-celledorganism found in pond water. Amoebahas a cell membrane, a rounded, dense\nnucleus and many small bubble-like\nvacuoles (Fig. 2.10) in its cytoplasm.Amoeba constantly changes its shape\nand position. It pushes out one, ormore finger-like projections, calledpseudopodia or false feet for movement\nand capture of food.\nPaheli wants to know why\nthese animals cannot chew\nfood properly at the time they\ntake it in?\npartially digested and is called cud.\nBut later the cud returns to the mouth\nin small lumps and the animal chews\nit. This process is called rumination  and\nthese animals are called ruminants .\nThe grass is rich in cellulose, a type\nof carbohydrate.

When it senses food, it\npushes out pseudopodia around the\nfood particle and engulfs it. The food\nbecomes trapped in a food vacuole\n[Fig. 2.10).\nDigestive juices are secreted into the\nfood vacuole. They act on the food andbreak it down into simpler substances.\nGradually the digested food is absorbed.The absorbed substances are used for\ngrowth, maintenance and multiplication.The undigested residue of the food is\nexpelled outside by the vacuole.\nThe basic process of digestion of\nfood and release of energy is the samein all animals. In a later chapter you\nwill learn about the transport of foodabsorbed by the intestine to the various\nparts of the body.\nWhat you have learnt\n\uf06eAnimal nutrition includes nutrient requirement, mode of intake of food\nand its utilisation in the body.\n\uf06eThe human digestive system consists of the alimentary canal andsecretory glands. It consists of the (i) buccal cavity, (ii) oesophagus,(iii) stomach, (iv) small intestine, (v) large intestine ending in rectumand (vi) anus. The main digestive glands which secrete digestive juicesare (i) the salivary glands, (ii) the liver and (iii) the pancreas. The stomachwall and the wall of the small intestine also secrete digestive juices.\n\uf06eThe modes of feeding vary in different organisms.\n\uf06eNutrition is a complex process involving: (i) ingestion, (ii) digestion,(iii) absorption, (iv) assimilation and  (v) egestion.Keywords\nAbsorption\nAmino acidAmoebaAssimilation\nBile\nBuccal cavityCanineCelluloseDigestionEgestionFatty acidFood vacuoleGall bladderGlycerolIncisor\nIngestion\nLiverMilk teethMolarPermanent teethOesophagusPancreasPremolarPseudopodiaRumen\nRuminant\nRuminationSalivary glandsVilli\nSaliva\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 20\n\uf06eDigestion of carbohydrates, like starch, begins in the buccal cavity. The\ndigestion of protein starts in the stomach.

The digested food is absorbed in the blood vesselsfrom the small intestine.\n\uf06eThe absorbed substances are transported to different parts of the body.Water and some salts are absorbed from the undigested food in thelarge intestine.\n\uf06eThe undigested and unabsorbed residues are expelled out of the bodyas faeces through the anus.\n\uf06eThe grazing animals like cows, buffaloes and deer are known asruminants.

Let us recall tastes of\nsome edible substances listed in\nTable 4.1. If you have not tasted any ofthese substances taste it now and enter\nthe result in Table 4.1.You find that some of these\nsubstances taste sour, some taste bitter,some taste sweet and some taste salty.\n4.1 A CIDS AND BASES\nCurd, lemon juice, orange juice and\nvinegar taste sour. These substancestaste sour because they contain acids .\nThe chemical nature of such substancesis acidic. The word acid comes from the\nLatin word acere  which means sour.\nThe acids in these substances arenatural acids.\nWhat about baking soda? Does it also\ntaste sour? If not, what is its taste? Since,it does not taste sour it means, that ithas no acids in it. It is bitter in taste. If\nyou rub it s solution between fingers, it\nfeels soapy. Generally, substances like\nthese which are bitter in taste and feel\nsoapy on touching are known as bases .\nThe nature of such substances is said to\nbe basic .\nIf we cannot taste every substance,\nhow do we find its nature?\nSpecial type of substances are used\nto test whether a substance is acidic orbasic. These substances are known asindicators. The indicators change their\ncolour when added to a solution\ncontaining an acidic or a basicsubstance. Turmeric, litmus, China rose\npetals ( Gudhal ), etc., are some of the\nnaturally occurring indicators.CAUTION\n1. Do not taste anything unless asked\nto do so.\n2.

Let us see what happens when an\nacid is mixed with a base.\nWe are going to use an indicator you\nhave not used so far. It is calledphenolphthalein .\nActivity 4.5\nTo be demonstrated by the teacher in\nthe class\nFill one fourth of a test tube with dilute\nhydrochloric acid. Note down its colour.Note down the colour of phenolphthalein\nsolution also. Add 2\u20133 drops of theindicator to the acid. Now shake the test\ntube gently. Do you observe any change\nin colour of the acid?\nAdd to the acidic solution a drop of\nsodium hydroxide solution by a dropper.Are you familiar with the term acid rain? Have you ever heard about damagingeffect of acid rain? As the name indicates the rain containing excess of acids is\ncalled an acid rain. Where do these acids come from? The rain becomes acidic\nbecause carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide (which are releasedinto the air as pollutants) dissolve in rain drops to form carbonic acid, sulphuric\nacid and nitric acid respectively. Acid rain can cause damage to buildings,\nhistorical monuments, plants and animals.\nCAUTION\nGreat care should be taken whilehandling laboratory acids and basesbecause these are corrosive in nature,\nirritating and harmful to skin.\nBase\nAcid + Indicator\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 44When an acidic solution is mixed\nwith a basic solution, both the solutions\nneutralise the effect of each other. When\nan acid solution and a base solution are\nmixed in suitable amounts, both theacidic nature of the acid and the basic\nnature of the base are destroyed. The\nresulting solution is neither acidic norbasic. Touch the test tube immediately\nafter neutralisation. What do you\nobserve? In neutralisation reaction, heatis always produced, or evolved. The\nevolved heat raises the temperature of\nthe reaction mixture.\nIn neutralisation reaction a new\nsubstance is formed. This is called salt.Salt may be acidic, basic or neutral innature. Thus, neutralisation can be\ndefined as follows:\nThe reaction between an acid and\na base is known as neutralisation. Saltand water are produced in this process\nwith the evolution of heat.\nAcid+Base \uf0ae Salt+Water\n     (Heat is evolved)\nThe following reaction is an example:Hydrochloric acid (HCl) + Sodium\nhydroxide (NaOH) \uf0ae\nSodium chloride (NaCl) + Water (H\n2O)\nBoojho added dilute sulphuric acid\nto lime water. Will the reaction mixturebecome hot or cool?\n4.4 N EUTRALISATION  IN EVERYDAY\nLIFE\nIndigestion\nOur stomach contains hydrochloricacid. It helps us to digest food, as youhave learnt in Chapter 2. But toomuch of acid in the stomach causesindigestion. Sometimes indigestion\nis painful. To relieve indigestion, we\ntake an antacid such as milk ofmagnesia, which contains magnesium\nhydroxide. It neutralises the effect of\nexcessive acid.\nAnt bite\nWhen an ant bites, it injectsthe acidic liquid (formic acid) into theskin. The effect of the acid can be\nneutralised by rubbing moist baking\nsoda (sodium hydrogencarbonate) orcalamine solution, which contains zinc\ncarbonate.\nSoil treatment\nExcessive use of chemical fertilisers\nmakes the soil acidic. Plants do notgrow well when the soil is either too\nacidic  or too basic . When the soil is\ntoo acidic, it is treated with bases like\nquick lime (calcium oxide) or slaked\nlime (calcium hydroxide). If the soil\nis basic, organic matter (compost) is\nadded to it. Organic matter releases\nacids which neutralises the basic\nnature of the soil.\nFactory wastes\nThe wastes of many factoriescontain acids. If they are allowed to\nflow into the water bodies, the acids\nwill kill fish and other organisms.The factory wastes are, therefore,\nneutralised by adding basic\nsubstances.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nACIDS, BASES AND SALTS 45\nWhat you have learnt\n\uf06eAcids are sour in taste. Generally, bases are bitter in taste and soapy to\ntouch.\n\uf06eAcid turns blue litmus red. Bases turn red litmus blue.\n\uf06eSubstances which are neither acidic nor basic are called neutral.\n\uf06eSolutions of substances that show different colour in acidic, basic andneutral solutions are called indicators.\n\uf06eAn acid and a base neutralise each other and form a salt.

Wastewater is passed through bar\nscreens. Large objects like rags,\nsticks, cans, plastic packets, napkins\nare removed (Fig. 13.3).\nFig. 13.2  Filtration process\nFig. 13.3  Bar screen\nFig. 13.4  Grit and sand removal tank2. Water then goes to a grit and sand\nremoval tank. The speed of theincoming wastewater is decreased to\nallow sand, grit and pebbles to settledown (Fig. 13.4).\n3. The water is then allowed to settle in\na large tank which is sloped towardsthe middle. Solids like faeces settleat the bottom and are removed with\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 160After several hours, the suspended\nmicrobes settle at the bottom of the tank\nas activated sludge. The water is then\nremoved from the top.\nThe activated sludge is about 97%\nwater. The water is removed by sanddrying beds or machines. Dried sludge\nis used as manure, returning organicmatter and nutrients to the soil.\nThe treated water has a very low level\nof organic material and suspendedmatter. It is discharged into a sea, a river\nor into the ground. Nature cleans it up\nfurther.  Sometimes it may be necessaryto disinfect water with chemicals like\nchlorine and ozone before releasing it\ninto the distribution system.\nBecome an active citizen\nWaste generation is a natural part ofhuman activity. But we can limit the\na scraper. This is the sludge . A\nskimmer removes the floatable solidslike oil and grease. Water so clearedis called clarified water (Fig. 13.5).\nThe sludge is transferred to a\nseparate tank where it is decomposed\nby the anaerobic bacteria. The biogas\nproduced in the process can be used as\nfuel or can be used to produce electricity.4. Air is pumped into the clarified water\nto help aerobic bacteria to grow.Bacteria consume human waste, foodwaste, soaps and other unwanted\nmatter still remaining in clarified\nwater (Fig. 13.6).\nFig. 13.6  AeratorDid you know ?\nIt has been suggested that we should\nplant eucalyptus trees all along\nsewage ponds.

Throw oil and fats in the\ndustbin.\nFig. 13.7  Do not throw everything in the sink\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 16213.6 S ANITATION  AND DISEASE\nPoor sanitation and contaminated\ndrinking water is the cause of a large\nnumber of diseases.\nLet us look at our own country. A\nvast number of our people are still\nwithout sewerage facilities. Where dothey relieve themselves?\nA very large fraction of our people\ndefecates in the open, on dry riverbeds,\non railway tracks, near fields and many\na time directly in water. Untreated\nhuman excreta is a health hazard. It\nmay cause water pollution and soilpollution. Both the surface water and\ngroundwater get polluted. Groundwater\nis a source of water for wells, tubewells,\nsprings and many rivers. Thus, it\nbecomes the most common route forwater borne diseases. They include\ncholera, typhoid, polio, meningitis,\nhepatitis and dysentery.\nBhoojo wants to know how\nsewage is disposed of in an\naeroplane.\n13.7 A LTERNATIVE  ARRANGEMENT\nFOR SEWAGE  DISPOSAL\nTo improve sanitation, low cost onsite\nsewage disposal systems are being\nencouraged. Examples are septic tanks,\nchemical toilets, composting pits. Septictanks are suitable for places where there\nis no sewerage system, for hospitals,\nisolated buildings or a cluster of 4 to 5houses.\nSome organisations offer hygienic\non-site human waste disposaltechnology. These toilets do not require\nscavenging. Excreta from the toilet seats\nflow through covered drains into abiogas plant. The biogas produced is\nused as a source of energy.\n13.8 S ANITATION  AT PUBLIC PLACES\nIn our country fairs are organisedperiodically. A large number of people\nparticipate in them. In the same wayrailway stations, bus depots, airports,\nhospitals are very busy places.\nThousands of people visit them daily.Large amount of waste is generatedVermi-processing toilet\nA design of  a toilet in which humans excreta is treated by earthworms has beentested in India. It has been found to be a novel, low water-use toilet for safe\nprocessing of human waste. The operation of the toilet is very simple and hygienic.\nThe human excreta is completely converted to vermi cakes \u2014 a resource muchneeded for soil.In the year 2016, the Government of India has initiated a new mission known as\u201cSwachh Bharat\u201d under which a lot of drives such as proper sewage disposal\nand providing toilets for everyone have been started.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nWASTEWATER  STORY 163\nWhat you have learnt\n\uf06eUsed water is wastewater. Wastewater could be reused.\n\uf06eWastewater is generated in homes, industries, agricultural fields and in\nother human activities. This is called sewage.\n\uf06eSewage is a liquid waste which causes water and soil pollution.\n\uf06eWastewater is treated in a sewage treatment plant.\n\uf06eTreatment plants reduce pollutants in wastewater to a level where naturecan take care of it.\n\uf06eWhere underground sewerage systems and refuse disposal systems arenot available, the low cost on-site sanitation system can be adopted.\n\uf06eBy-products of wastewater treatment are sludge and biogas.\n\uf06eOpen drain system is a breeding place for flies, mosquitoes and organismswhich cause diseases.\n\uf06eWe should not defecate in the open. It is possible to have safe disposal ofexcreta by low cost methods.here. It must be disposed of properly\notherwise epidemics could break out.\nThe government has laid down\ncertain standards of sanitation but,unfortunately, they are not strictlyenforced.\nHowever, all of us can contribute in\nmaintaining sanitation at public places.We should not scatter litter anywhere.\nIf there is no dustbin in sight, we should\ncarry the litter home and throw it in thedustbin.\nConclusion\nWe all have a role to play in keeping ourenvironment clean and healthy.

If not, you may try it out now.\nPaheli and Boojho had also set up the\ngame by connecting an electric circuit\nas suggested in Class VI. They had lotsof fun trying it out with their families\nand friends. They enjoyed it so much\nthat they decided to suggest it to acousin of theirs who stayed in a\ndifferent town. So, Paheli made a neat\ndrawing showing how the variouselectric components were to be\nconnected (Fig.10.1).\nFig. 10.1  Setup to check how steady\nyour hand is\nCan you draw this circuit\nconveniently? It made Boojho wonder ifthere was an easier way to represent\nthese electric components.10.1 S YMBOLS  OF ELECTRIC\nCOMPONENTS\nSome common electric components canbe represented by symbols. In Table 10.1,\nsome electric components and their\nsymbols are shown. You may come\nacross different symbols for thesecomponents in different books. However,\nin this book, we shall be using the\nsymbols shown here.\nLook at the symbols carefully. In the\nsymbol for the electric cell, notice thatthere is a longer line and a shorter butthicker parallel line. Do you recall that\nan electric cell has a positive terminal\nand a negative terminal? In the symbolof the electric cell, the longer line\nrepresents the positive terminal and the\nthicker, shorter line represents thenegative terminal.\nFor a switch the \u2018ON\u2019 position and\nthe \u2018OFF\u2019 position are represented by thesymbols as shown. The wires used to\nconnect the various components in a\ncircuit are represented by lines.\nIn Table 10.1, a battery and its\nsymbol are also shown. Do you knowwhat a battery is? Look at the symbol of\na battery. Can you make out what a\nbattery could be? For some of the\nactivities we may need more than onecell. So, we connect two or more cells\ntogether as shown in Fig.10.2. Notice\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 110Many devices such as torches,\ntransistors, toys, TV remote controls, use\nbatteries. However, in some of these\ndevices the electric cells are not always\nplaced one after the other as shown inFig. 10.2. Sometimes the cells are placed\nside by side. Then how are the terminals\nof the cells connected? Look carefullyinside the battery compartment of any\ndevice. There is usually a thick wire or\na metal strip connecting the positiveterminal of one cell to the negative\nterminal of the next cell (Fig.10.3). In\norder to help you to place the cellscorrectly in the battery compartment,\n\u2018+\u2019 and \u2018\u2013\u2019 symbols are usually printed\nthere.\nHow can we connect the cells to\nprepare batteries for our activities?

Your battery is ready foruse.\nThe symbol used for representing a\nbattery is shown in Table.10.1.\nLet us now draw a circuit diagram of\nan electric circuit using symbols shownin Table 10.1.\nActivity 10.1\nMake the electric circuit shown inFig. 10.7. You used a similar circuit\nin Class VI to make an electric bulb\nglow. Do you remember that the bulbglows only when the switch is in the\n\u2018ON\u2019 position? The bulb glows as soon\nas the switch is moved to the \u2018ON\u2019position.\n Copy this electric circuit in your\nnotebook. Make also a circuit diagramof this circuit using symbols for the\nvarious electric components.\nIs your diagram similar to the one\nshown in Fig. 10.8?\nIt is much easier to draw a circuit\ndiagram using symbols. Therefore, we\ngenerally represent an electric circuit by\nits circuit diagram.\nFig. 10.9 shows another circuit\ndiagram. Is it identical to the circuitdiagram shown in Fig.10.8? In which\nway is it different?\nWould the bulb glow in this electric\ncircuit?

After movingthe switch back to the \u2018OFF\u2019 position,\ntouch the bulb again.\nActivity 10.3\nMake a circuit as shown in Fig.10.10.\nTake about 10 cm long piece of nichromewire and tie it between the nails. (You\ncan get nichrome wire from an electric\nrepair shop or you can use a piece ofdiscarded coil of an electric heater.)\nTouch the wire. Now switch on the\ncurrent in the circuit by moving theswitch to the \u2018ON\u2019 position. After a fewThe wire gets hot when an electric\ncurrent passes through it.

Switch off the current.\nTouch the wire again after a few\nminutes.You might have seen an electric room\nheater or an electric heater used forcooking. All these contain a coil of wire.\nThis coil of wire is called an element.\nYou may have noticed that when theseappliances are switched on after\nCAUTION\nDo not keep the switch in the \u2018ON\u2019\nposition for a long time, otherwise the\ncell may become weak very quickly.\nBoojho could not see element in anelectric iron.  Paheli told him thatelectrical appliances, such as\nimmersion heaters, hotplates, irons,\ngeysers, electric kettles, hair dryers,have elements inside them.

Thus, for different\nrequirements, the wires of different\nmaterials and different lengths and\nthicknesses are used.\nThe wires used for making electric\ncircuits do not normally become hot. On\nthe other hand, the elements of some\nelectric appliances become so hot that\nthey are easily visible. The filament of\nFig. 10.12  Glowing filament of an electric bulb\n(incandescent)\nIncandescent electric bulbs (Fig. 10.12) are often used for lighting but they also\ngive heat. It means that a part of electricity consumed is used in producing\nheat. This is not desirable as it results in the wastage of electricity. The fluorescenttube-lights and compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) are better electricity efficient\nlighting sources. Nowadays, the use of light emitting diode (LED) bulbs is\nincreasing. For producing a given intensity of light, LED bulbs consume lesselectricity as compared to incandescent bulbs or fluorescent tubes or CFLs.Thus\nLED bulbs are much electricity efficient and therefore being preferred.\nFig. 10.13  Electric bulb, tube-light, CFL and LED\nIt is advised to use electrical appliances and gadgets, which are electricity efficient.\nBureau of Indian Standards, New Delhi assigns a Standard Mark on products,\ncalled ISI mark  which is an assurance of conformity to the specifications\ngiven on the products. It is therefore suggested to use ISI mark products.\nNote: Fluorescent tubes and CFLs contain mercury vapour, toxic in nature.\nTherefore, damaged fluorescent tubes or CFLs need to be disposed off safely.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nELECTRIC  CURRENT  AND ITS EFFECTS 115One reason for excessive currents in\nelectrical circuits is the direct\ntouching of wires. This may happen if\nthe insulation on the wires has comeoff due to wear and tear.  This may\ncause a short circuit. Another reason\nfor excessive current can be theconnection of many devices to a single\nsocket.  This may cause overload in\nthe circuit. You might have readreports in newspapers about fires\ncaused by short circuits and\noverloads.buildings fuses are inserted in all\nelectrical circuits. There is a maximum\nlimit on the current which can safelyflow through a circuit. If by accident the\ncurrent exceeds this safe limit, the wiresan electric bulb gets heated to such a\nhigh temperature that it starts glowing.\nIf a large current passes through a\nwire, the wire may become so hot that it\nmay even melt and break. But is it\npossible for a wire to melt and break?\nLet us check it out.\nActivity 10.4\nMake the circuit we used for Activity 10.3\nagain. However, replace the cell with a\nbattery of four cells. Also, in place ofthe nichrome wire, tie a thin strand of\nsteel wool. (The steel wool is commonly\nused for cleaning utensils and isavailable in grocery shops.) If there are\nany fans in the room, switch them off.\nNow pass the current through the circuitfor sometime. Observe the strand of steel\nwool carefully. Note what happens.  Does\nthe strand of steel wool melt and break?\nWires made from some special\nmaterials melt quickly and break whenlarge electric currents are passedthrough them. These wires are used for\nmaking electric fuses  (Fig.10.14). In allCAUTION\nNever try to investigate an electric fuse\nconnected to mains circuit on yourown.

Bring a barmagnet near the compass needle.Observe what happens. Now, while\nwatching the compass needle carefully,\nmove the switch to the \u2018ON\u2019 position.These days Miniaturecircuit breakers (MCBs)are increasingly being\nused in place of fuses.\nThese are switches whichautomatically turn off\nwhen current in a circuit\nexceeds the safe limit.

Do the pins cling to the\ntip of the nail? Switch off the current.Are the pins still clinging to the end of\nthe nail?\nThe coil in the above activity behaves\nlike a magnet when electric current flowsthrough it. When the electric current is\nswitched off, the coil generally loses itsmagnetism. Such coils are called\nelectromagnets . The electromagnets\ncan be made very strong and can lift\nvery heavy loads. Do you remember the\ncrane about which you read in Chapter 10\nof Class VI? The end of such a cranehas a strong electromagnet attached to\nit. The electromagnets are also used to\nseparate magnetic material from thejunk.

Move the switch back tothe \u2018OFF\u2019 position. Does the compass\nneedle come back to its initial position?\nRepeat the experiment a few times.\nWhat does this experiment indicate?\nWe know that the needle of a compass\nis a tiny magnet, which points in\nnorth-south direction. When we bring\na magnet close to it, the needle gets\ndeflected. We have also seen thatcompass needle gets deflected when the\ncurrent flows in a nearby wire. Can you\nconnect the two observations? When thecurrent flows through a wire, does the\nwire behave like a magnet?\nThis is what a scientist called Hans\nChristian Oersted (Fig. 10.18)  also\nwondered. He was the first person who\nnoticed the deflection of compass needleevery time the current was passed\nthrough the wire.\nSo, when electric current passes\nthrough a wire, it behaves like a magnet.This is the magnetic effect of the electric\ncurrent. In fact, an electric current canbe used to make magnets. Do you find\nit too surprising?  Let us try it out.Remember not to switch on thecurrent for more than a few seconds\nat a time.

            "text": "Motion and Time9\nIn Class VI, you learnt about different\ntypes of motions. You learnt that a\nmotion could be along a straight line,\nit could be circular or periodic. Can you\nrecall these three types of motions?\nTable 9.1 gives some common\nexamples of motions. Identify the typeof motion in each case.9.1 S LOW OR FAST\nWe know that some vehicles move fasterthan others. Even the same vehicle maymove faster or slower at different times.\nMake a list of ten objects moving along\na straight path. Group the motion ofthese objects as slow and fast. How did\nyou decide which object is moving slow\nand which one is moving fast?\nIf vehicles are moving on a road in\nthe same direction, we can easily tellwhich one of them is moving faster thanthe other. Let us look at the motion of\nvehicles moving on a road.\nActivity 9.1\nLook at Fig. 9.1. It shows the position\nof some vehicles moving on a road inthe same direction at some instant of\ntime. Now look at Fig. 9.2. It shows the\nposition of the same vehicles after sometime. From your observation of the two\nfigures, answer the following questions:\nWhich vehicle is moving the fastest\nof all? Which one of them is moving theslowest of all?\nThe distance moved by objects in a\ngiven interval of time can help us todecide which one is faster or slower. For\nexample, imagine that you have gone tosee off your friend at the bus stand.\nSuppose you start pedalling your bicycle\nat the same time as the bus begins toTable 9.1 Some examples of\ndifferent types of motion\nExample of Type of motion\nmotion Along a straight\nline/circular/\nperiodic\nSoldiers in a\nmarch past\nBullock cart\nmoving on a\nstraight road\nHands of an\nathlete in a race\nPedal of a bicycle\nin motion\nMotion of the Earth\naround the Sun\nMotion of a swing\nMotion  of a\npendulum\nIt is common experience that the\nmotion of some objects is slow while that\nof some others is fast.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nMOTION  AND TIME 93move. The distance covered by you after\n5 minutes would be much smaller thanthat covered by the bus. Would you say\nthat the bus is moving faster than the\nbicycle?\nWe often say that the faster vehicle\nhas a higher speed.  In a 100-metre raceit is easy to decide whose speedis the highest. One who takesshortest time to cover the\ndistance of 100 metres has the\nhighest speed.\n9.2 S PEED\nYou are probably familiar withthe word speed. In theexamples given above, a higher\nspeed seems to indicate that a\ngiven distance has beencovered in a shorter time, or a\nlarger distance covered in a\ngiven time.\nThe most convenient way to\nfind out which of the two ormore objects is moving fasteris to compare the distances\nmoved by them in a unit time.\nThus, if we know the distancecovered by two buses in one\nhour, we can tell which one is\nfaster. We call the distancecovered by an object in a unit\ntime as the speed  of the object.\nWhen we say that a car is\nmoving with a speed of 50kilometres per hour, it implies\nthat it will cover a distance of\nFig. 9.2  Position of vehicles shown in\nFig. 9.1 after some timeFig. 9.1  Vehicles moving in the same\ndirection on a road\n50 kilometres in one hour. However, a\ncar seldom moves with a constant speed\nfor one hour. In fact, it starts movingslowly and then picks up speed. So,\nwhen we say that the car has a speed of\n50 kilometres per hour, we usuallyconsider only the total distance covered\nby it in one hour. We do not bother\nwhether the car has been moving with\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 94We can determine the speed of a given\nobject once we can measure the time\ntaken by it to cover a certain distance.\nIn Class VI you learnt how to measuredistances. But, how do we measure\ntime? Let us find out.\n9.3 M EASUREMENT  OF TIME\nIf you did not have a clock, how wouldyou decide what time of the day it is?\nHave you ever wondered how our elderscould tell the approximate time of the\nday by just looking at shadows?\nHow do we measure time interval of\na month? A year?\nOur ancestors noticed that many\nevents in nature repeat themselves after\ndefinite intervals of time. For example,they found that the sun rises everydayin the morning. The time between onesunrise and the next was called a day.\nSimilarly, a month was measured from\none new moon to the next. A year wasfixed as the time taken by the earth to\ncomplete one revolution of the sun.\nOften we need to measure intervals\nof time which are much shorter than aday. Clocks or watches are perhaps the\nmost common time measuring devices.Have you ever wondered how clocks and\nwatches measure time?\nThe working of clocks is rather\ncomplex. But all of them make use ofsome periodic motion. One of the most\nwell-known periodic motions is that ofa simple pendulum.\nIn everyday life we seldom find objects\nmoving with a constant speed over long\ndistances or for long durations of time.If the speed of an object moving along\na straight line keeps changing, its\nmotion is said to be non-uniform. On\nthe other hand, an object moving along\na straight line with a constant speed\nis said to be in uniform motion . In\nthis case, the average speed is the\nsame as the actual speed.\nFig. 9.3  Some common clocks(b) Table clock\n(c) Digital clock(a) Wall clock\na constant speed or not during that\nhour. The speed calculated here isactually the average speed of the car. In\nthis book we shall use the term speed\nfor average speed. So, for us the speed\nis the total distance covered divided\nby the total time taken . Thus,\nTotal distance coveredSpeed = Total time taken\nReprint 2024-25\n\nMOTION  AND TIME 95A simple pendulum consists of a\nsmall metallic ball or a piece of stone\nsuspended from a rigid stand by athread [Fig. 9.4 (a)]. The metallic ball is\ncalled the bob of the pendulum.\nFig. 9.4 (a) shows the pendulum at\nrest in its mean position. When the bobof the pendulum is released after taking\nit slightly to one side, it begins to moveto and fro [Fig. 9.4 (b)]. The to and fro\nmotion of a simple pendulum is an\nexample of a periodic or an oscillatorymotion.\nThe pendulum is said to have\ncompleted one oscillation  when its bob,\nstarting from its mean position O, movesTo set the pendulum in motion,\ngently hold the bob and move it slightly\nto one side. Make sure that the string\nattached to the bob is taut while youdisplace it. Now release the bob from its\ndisplaced position. Remember that the\nbob is not to be pushed when it isreleased. Note the time on the clock\nwhen the bob is at its mean position.\nInstead of the mean position you maynote the time when the bob is at one of\nits extreme positions. Measure the time\nthe pendulum takes to complete 20oscillations. Record your observationsFig. 9.4  (b) Different\npositions of the bob of an\noscillating simple pendulumFig. 9.4  (a) A simple\npendulumto A, to B and back to O. Thependulum also completes oneoscillation when its bob moves\nfrom one extreme position A to the\nother extreme position B andcomes back to A. The time taken\nby the pendulum to complete one\noscillation is called its time\nperiod .\nActivity 9.2\nSet up a simple pendulum as\nshown in Fig. 9.4 (a) with a\nthread or string of length nearlyone metre. Switch off any fans\nnearby. Let the bob of the\npendulum come to rest at itsmean position. Mark the mean\nposition of the bob on the floor\nbelow it or on the wall behind it.\nTo measure the time period of\nthe pendulum we will needa stopwatch. However, if astopwatch is not available, a table\nclock or a wristwatch can be used.A\nOB\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 96Table 9.2 Time period of a simple\npendulum\nLength of the string = 100 cm\nS.No. Time taken for 20 Time period\noscillations (s) (s)\n1. 42 2.1\n2.\n3.cells. These clocks are called quartz\nclocks. The time measured by quartzclocks is much more accurate than that\nby the clocks available earlier.\nUnits of time and speed\nThe basic unit of time is a second. Its\nsymbol is s. Larger units of time are\nminutes (min) and hours (h). Youalready know how these units are related\nto one another.\nWhat would be the basic unit of\nspeed?\nSince the speed is distance/time, the\nbasic unit of speed is m/s. Of course, it\ncould also be expressed in other units\nsuch as m/min or km/h.\nYou must remember that the\nsymbols of all units are written insingular . For example, we write 50 km\nand not 50 kms, or 8 cm and not 8 cms.\nBoojho is wondering how many\nseconds there are in a day and how\nmany hours in a year. Can you helphim?in Table 9.2. The first observation shownis just a sample. Your observations couldbe different from this. Repeat this\nactivity a few times and record your\nobservations. By dividing the time takenfor 20 oscillations by 20, get the time\ntaken for one oscillation, or the time\nperiod of the pendulum.\nIs the time period of your pendulum\nnearly the same in all cases?\nNote that a slight change in the\ninitial displacement does not affect the\ntime period of your pendulum.\nNowadays most clocks or watches\nhave an electric circuit with one or more\nThere is an interesting story about the discovery that the time period of a givenpendulum is constant. You might have heard the name of famous scientist\nGalileo Galilie (A.D. 1564 \u20131642). It is said that once Galileo was sitting in achurch. He noticed that a lamp suspended from the ceiling with a chain was\nmoving slowly from one side to the other. He was surprised to find that his\npulse beat the same number of times during the interval in which the lampcompleted one oscillation. Galileo experimented with various pendulums to\nverify his observation. He found that a pendulum of a given length takes always\nthe same time to complete one oscillation. This observation led to thedevelopment of pendulum clocks. Winding clocks and wristwatches were\nrefinements of the pendulum clocks.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nMOTION  AND TIME 97Different units of time are used\ndepending on the need.  For example, it\nis convenient to express your age in\nyears rather than in days or hours.\nSimilarly, it will not be wise to expressin years the time taken by you to cover\nthe distance between your home and\nyour school.\nHow small or large is a time interval\nof one second? The time taken in sayingaloud \u201ctwo thousand and one\u201d is nearbyone second. Verify it by counting aloud\nfrom \u201ctwo thousand and one\u201d to \u201ctwo\nthousand and ten\u201d. The pulse of anormal healthy adult at rest beats about\n72 times in a minute that is about 12\ntimes in 10 seconds.  This rate may beslightly higher for children.\nPaheli wondered how time was\nmeasured when pendulum\nclocks were not available.\nMany time measuring devices were\nused in different parts of the world beforethe pendulum clocks became popular.\nSundials, water clocks and sand clocks\nare some examples of such devices.Different designs of these devices were\ndeveloped in different parts of the world\n(Fig. 9.5).\n9.4 M EASURING  SPEED\nHaving learnt how to measure time anddistance, you can calculate the speed ofan object. Let us find the speed of a ball\nmoving along the ground.\nActivity 9.3\nDraw a straight line on the ground with\nchalk powder or lime and ask one of\nyour friends to stand 1 to 2 m away from\nit. Let your friend gently roll a ball alongthe ground in a direction perpendicular\nto the line. Note the time at the moment\nthe ball crosses the line and also whenit comes to rest (Fig. 9.6). How much\ntime does the ball take to come to rest?\nThe smallest time interval that can be measured with commonly availableclocks and watches is one second. However, now special clocks are available\nthat can measure time intervals smaller than a second.  Some of these clockscan measure time intervals as small as one millionth or even one billionth of a\nsecond. You might have heard the terms like microsecond and nanosecond.\nOne microsecond is one millionth of a second. A nanosecond is one billionthof a second. Clocks that measure such small time intervals are used for scientific\nresearch. The time measuring devices used in sports can measure time intervals\nthat are one tenth or one hundredth of a second. On the other hand, times ofhistorical events are stated in terms of centuries or millenniums. The ages of\nstars and planet are often expressed in billions of years. Can you imagine the\nrange of time intervals that we have to deal with?\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 98Measure the distance between the point\nat which the ball crosses the line and\nthe point where it comes to rest. Youcan use a scale or a measuring\ntape. Let different groups repeat the\nactivity. Record the measurements inTable 9.3. In each case calculate the\nspeed of the ball.\nYou may now like to compare your\nspeed of walking or cycling with that ofyour friends. You need to know the\ndistance of the school from your homeor from some other point. Each one of\nyou can then measure the time taken\nto cover that distance and calculate yourspeed. It may be interesting to know who\namongst you is the fastest.

You can calculate\nthe speeds in m/s yourself.\nRockets, launching satellites into\nearth\u2019s orbit, often attain speeds up to8 km/s. On the other hand, a tortoise\ncan move only with a speed of about 8\ncm/s. Can you calculate how fast is therocket compared with the tortoise?\nOnce you know the speed of an\nobject, you can find the distance movedby it in a given time. All you have to do\nis to multiply the speed by time. Thus,\nDistance covered = Speed \u00d7 Time\nYou can also find the time an object\nwould take to cover a distance while\nmoving with a given speed.You might have seen a meter fitted\non top of a scooter or a motorcycle.Similarly, meters can be seen on the\ndashboards of cars, buses and other\nvehicles. Fig. 9.7 shows the dashboardof a car. Note that one of the meters has\nkm/h written at one corner. This is\ncalled a speedometer .

Can you calculatethe speed of the bus? Looking at theTable, Boojho asked Paheli whether she\ncan tell how far they would have\ntravelled till 9:45 AM. Paheli had noanswer to this question. They went to\ntheir teacher. She told them that one\nway to solve this problem is to plot adistance-time graph. Let us find out how\nsuch a graph is plotted.Table 9.5 Odometer reading at\ndifferent times of the journey\nTime Odometer Distance from\n(AM) reading the starting\npoint\n8:00 AM 36540 km 0 km\n8:30 AM 36560 km 20 km\n9:00 AM 36580 km 40 km\n9:30 AM 36600 km 60 km10:00 AM 36620 km 80 km9.5 D ISTANCE -TIME GRAPH\nYou might have seen that newspapers,\nmagazines, etc., present information in\nvarious forms of graphs to make it\nFig. 9.8  A bar graph showing runs scored by a\nteam in each over\ninteresting.

The twoquantities between which the graph is\ndrawn are shown along these two axes.We show the positive values on the\nx-axis along OX. Similarly, positive\nvalues on the y-axis are shown alongOY. In this chapter we shall consider\nonly the positive values of quantities.Therefore, we shall use only the shadedpart of the graph shown in Fig. 9.11.\nBoojho and Paheli found out the\ndistance travelled by a car and the timetaken by it to cover that distance.

For the motionof the car scales could be\nTime: 1 min = 1 cm\nDistance: 1 km = 1 cm\n\uf0a7Mark values for the time and thedistance on the respective axes\naccording to the scale you have\nchosen. For the motion of the carmark the time 1 min, 2 min, \u2026 onthe x-axis from the origin O.\nSimilarly, mark the distance 1 km,\n2 km \u2026 on the y-axis (Fig. 9.12).\n\uf0a7Now you have to mark the points onthe graph paper to represent each\nset of values for distance and time.\nObservation recorded at S. No. 1in Table 9.6 shows that at time0 min the distance moved is also\nzero. The point corresponding to this\nset of values on the graph willtherefore be the origin itself. After 1minute, the car has moved a distance\nof 1 km. To mark this set of values\nlook for the point that represents1 minute on the x-axis. Draw a lineparallel to the y-axis at this point.\nThen draw a line parallel to the\nx-axis from the point correspondingto distance 1 km on the y-axis. Thepoint where these two lines\nintersect represents this set of values\non the graph (Fig. 9.12). Similarly,mark on the graph paper thepoints corresponding to different\nsets of values.\uf0a7Fig. 9.12 shows the set of points onthe graph corresponding to positions\nof the car at various times.\n\uf0a7Join all the points on the graph as\nshown in Fig. 9.13. It is a straight\nline. This is the distance-time graph\nfor the motion of the car.\n\uf0a7If the distance-time graph is a\nstraight line, it indicates that the\nobject is moving with a constantspeed. However, if the speed of the\nobject keeps changing, the graph can\nbe of any other shape.Fig. 9.12  Making a graph\nFig. 9.13  Making a graphOXY\nXO\nY\nReprint 2024-25\n\nMOTION  AND TIME 103Generally, the choice of scales is not\nas simple as in the example given in\nFig. 9.12 and 9.13. We may have to\nchoose two different scales to represent\nthe desired quantities on the x-axis and\nthe y-axis. Let us try to understand this\nprocess with an example.\nLet us again consider the motion of\nthe bus that took Paheli and her friends\nto the picnic. The distance covered and\ntime taken by the bus are shown inTable 9.5. The total distance covered bythe bus is 80 km. If we decide to choose\na scale 1 km = 1 cm, we shall have to\ndraw an axis of length 80 cm. This isnot possible on a sheet of paper. On theother hand, a scale 10 km = 1 cm would\nrequire an axis of length only 8 cm. This\nscale is quite convenient. However, thegraph may cover only a small part ofthe graph paper.  Some of the points to\nbe kept in mind while choosing\nthe most suitable scale for drawing a\ngraph are:\uf0a7the difference between the highest\nand the lowest values of eachquantity.\n\uf0a7the intermediate values of eachquantity, so that with the scalechosen it is convenient to mark the\nvalues on the graph, and\n\uf0a7to utilise the maximum part of the\npaper on which the graph is to be\ndrawn.\nSuppose that you are given a graph\npaper of size 25 cm  \u00d7 25 cm. One of the\nscales which meets the above conditionsand can accommodate the data of Table9.5 could be\nDistance: 5 km = 1 cm, andTime: 6 min = 1 cmCan you now draw the distance-time\ngraph for the motion of the bus?

For example, Table 9.5 givesinformation about the distance moved\nby the bus only at some definite time\nintervals. On the other hand, from thedistance-time graph we can find the\ndistance moved by the bus at any\ninstant of time. Suppose we want toknow how much distance the bus had\ntravelled at 8:15  AM. We mark the point\ncorresponding to the time (8:15 AM) on\nthe x-axis (Fig. 9.14). Suppose this point\nis A.  Next we draw a line perpendicular\nto the x-axis (or parallel to the y-axis) atpoint A. We then mark the point, T, onthe graph at which this perpendicularline intersects it (Fig. 9.14). Next, we\ndraw a line through the point T parallel\nto the x-axis. This intersects the y-axisat the point B. The distance\ncorresponding to the point B on the y-\naxis, OB, gives us the distance in kmcovered by the bus at 8:15  AM. How\nmuch is this distance in km?

            "text": "Transportation in\nAnimals and Plants7\nYou have learnt earlier that all\norganisms need food, water and\noxygen for survival. They need to\ntransport all these to various parts of\ntheir body. Further, animals need to\ntransport wastes to parts from where\nthey can be removed. Have youwondered how all this is achieved? Look\nat Fig. 7.1. Do you see the heart and\nthe blood vessels? They function totransport substances and together form\nthe circulatory system. In this chapter,\nyou shall learn about transport ofsubstances in animals and plants.\n7.1 C IRCULATORY  SYSTEM\nBlood\nWhat happens when you get a cut on\nyour body? Blood flows out. But what\nis blood? Blood is the fluid which\nflows in blood vessels. It transports\nsubstances like digested food from the\nsmall intestine to the other parts of the\nbody. It carries oxygen from the lungs\nto the cells of the body. It also transports\nwaste for removal from the body.\nHow does the blood carry various\nsubstances? Blood is composed of a\nfluid, called plasma in which different\ntypes of cells are suspended.\nHeart\nVein\nArtery\nWhy is the colour of\nblood red?\nFig. 7.1  Circulatory system\n(Arteries are shown in red colour and veins in blue)\nReprint 2024-25\n\nTRANSPORTATION  IN ANIMALS  AND PLANTS 71One type of cells are the red blood\ncells (RBC) which contain a red pigment\ncalled haemoglobin . Haemoglobin\nbinds with oxygen and transports it to\nall the parts of the body and ultimatelyto all the cells. It will be difficult to\nprovide oxygen efficiently to all the cells\nof the body without haemoglobin. Thepresence of haemoglobin makes blood\nappear red.\nThe blood also has white blood cells\n(WBC) which fight against germs thatmay enter our body.\nBoojho fell down while playing a\ngame and his knee got injured. Bloodwas coming out from the cut. After some\ntime, he noticed that bleeding hadstopped and a dark red clot had plugged\nthe cut. Boojho was puzzled about this.\nThe clot is formed because of the\npresence of another type of cells in theblood, called platelets .\nBlood vessels\nThere are different types of blood vesselsin the body. You know that during\ninhalation a fresh supply of oxygen fillsthe lungs. Oxygen has to be transported\nto the rest of the body.\nAlso, the blood picks up the waste\nmaterials including carbon dioxide fromthe cells. This blood has to go back to\nthe heart for transport to the lungs forremoval of carbon dioxide as you have\nlearnt in Chapter 6. So, two types of\nblood vessels,  arteries  and veins are\npresent in the body.  (Fig. 7.1)\nArteries  carry oxygen-rich blood\nfrom the heart to all parts of the body.Since the blood flow is rapid and at ahigh pressure, the arteries have thickelastic walls.\nLet us perform an activity to study\nthe flow of blood through arteries.\nActivity 7.1\nPlace the middle and index finger ofyour right hand on the inner side of your\nleft wrist (Fig. 7.2). Can you feel some\nthrobbing movements? Why do youthink there is throbbing? This\nthrobbing is called the pulse and it is\ndue to the blood flowing in the arteries.Count the number of pulse beats in one\nminute.\nHow many pulse beats could you\ncount? The number of beats per minuteis called the pulse rate . A resting\nperson, usually has a pulse rate between\n72 and 80 beats per minute. Find other\nplaces in your body where you can feel\nthe pulse.\nRecord your own pulse beats per\nminute and those of your classmates.Insert the values you obtained inTable 7.1 and compare them.\nFig. 7.2  Pulse in the wrist\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 72Table 7.1 Pulse rate\nS. No. Name Pulse per minute\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.5.\nPaheli explained that the\npulmonary artery carries blood\nfrom the heart, so it is called an\nartery and not a vein. It carries\ncarbon dioxide-rich blood to the\nlungs. Pulmonary vein carries\noxygen-rich blood from the\nlungs to the heart. \nVeins  are the vessels which carry\ncarbon dioxide-rich blood from all parts\nof the body back to the heart. The veins\nhave thin walls. There are valves presentin veins which allow blood to flow only\ntowards the heart.\nRefer to Fig. 7.3. Do you see the\narteries divide into smaller vessels? On\nreaching the tissues, they divide further\ninto extremely thin tubes called\ncapillaries . The capillaries join to form\nveins which empty into the heart.\nHeart\nThe heart is an organ which beats\ncontinuously to act as a pump for the\ntransport of blood, which carries othersubstances with it.\nImagine a pump working for\nyears without stopping! Absolutelyimpossible. Yet our heart works like a\npump non-stop. Let us now learn about\nthe heart.\nThe heart is located in the chest\ncavity with its lower tip slightly tiltedtowards the left (Fig. 7.1). Hold yourfingers inwards on your palm.

Voluntary\nblood donation is harmless and\npainless and can save precious lives.\nBlood can be donated at hospitals andother places authorised by the\ngovernment. Donated blood are stored\nwith special care in Blood Banks.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nTRANSPORTATION  IN ANIMALS  AND PLANTS 73makes your fist. Your heart is roughly\nthe size of your fist.\nWhat will happen if the blood rich in\noxygen and the blood rich in carbondioxide mix with each other? To avoidthis from happening, the heart has fourchambers. The two upper chambers arecalled the atria (singular: atrium) and\nthe two lower chambers are called the\nventricles  (Fig. 7.4). The partition\nbetween the chambers  helps to avoid\nPaheli wonders which side of\nthe heart will have oxygen-rich\nblood and which side will have\ncarbon dioxide-rich blood.\nFig. 7.4  Sections of human heart\nVena Cava\nRight atrium\nRight ventriclePartition completely\nseparating the twohalvesLeft atrium\nLeft ventriclePulmonary artery\nPulmonary vein\nmixing up of blood rich in oxygen with\nthe blood rich in carbon dioxide.\nTo understand the functioning of the\ncirculatory system, start from the rightside of the heart in Fig. 7.3 and follow\nthe arrows. These arrows show thedirection of the blood flow from the heartAorta\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 74to the lungs and back to the heart from\nwhere it is pumped to the rest of thebody.\nHeartbeat\nThe walls of the chambers of the heart\nare made up of muscles. These muscles\ncontract and relax rhythmically. Thisrhythmic contraction followed by its\nrelaxation constitute a heartbeat.\nRemember that heartbeats continueevery moment of our life. If you place\nyour hand on the left side of your chest,\nyou can feel your heartbeat. The doctorfeels your heartbeats with the help of\nan instrument called a stethoscope.\nA doctor uses the stethoscope as a\ndevice to amplify the sound of the heart.It consists of a chest piece that carries a\nsensitive diaphragm, two ear pieces anda tube joining the parts. Doctors can\nget clues about the condition of yourheart by listening through a\nstethoscope.\nLet us construct a model of a\nstethoscope with the materials that areavailable around us.\nActivity 7.2\nTake a small funnel of 6\u20137 cm indiameter. Fix a rubber tube (50 cm long)\ntightly on the stem of the funnel. Stretch\na rubber sheet (or a balloon) on themouth of the funnel and fix it tightly\nwith a rubber band. Put the open end\nof the tube on one of your ears.

Now try to listencarefully. Do you hear a regular\nthumping sound ? The sound is that of\nheart beats. How many times did yourheart beat in a minute ? Count again\nafter running for 4\u20135 minutes. Compare\nyour observations.\nRecord your own pulse rate and heart\nbeat and that of your friends whileresting and after running and record inTable 7.2. Do you find any relationship\nbetween your heart beat and pulse rate?\nEach heart beat generates one pulse inthe arteries and the pulse rate per\nminute indicates the rate of heart beat.\nThe rhythmic beating of the various\nchambers of the heart maintaincirculation of blood and transport of\nsubstances to the different parts of thebody.\nBoojho wonders if sponges and\nhydra  also have blood? Animals such\nas sponges and Hydra do not possess\nany circulatory system. The water inwhich they live brings food and oxygenas it enters their bodies. The watercarries away waste materials and carbondioxide as it moves out. Thus, these\nanimals do not need a circulatory fluid\nlike the blood.\nLet us now learn about the removal\nof waste other than carbon dioxide.\n7.2 E XCRETION  IN ANIMALS\nRecall how carbon dioxide is removed\nas waste from the body through the\nlungs during exhalation. Also recall thatthe undigested food is removed during\negestion. Let us now find out how the\nother waste materials are removed fromthe body. You may wonder where these\nunwanted materials come from!\nWhen our cells perform their\nfunctions, certain waste products arereleased. These are toxic and hence need\nto be removed from the body. Theprocess of removal of wastes produced\nin the cells of the living organisms is\ncalled excretion . The parts involved in\nexcretion form the excretory system .\nExcretory system in humans\nThe waste which is present in the blood\nhas to be removed from the body. How\ncan this be done? A mechanism to filterthe blood is required. This is done by\nthe blood capillaries in the kidneys .\nWhen the blood reaches the two kidneys,\nit contains both useful and harmful\nsubstances. The useful substances are\nabsorbed back into the blood. Thewastes dissolved in water are removed\nas urine . From the kidneys, the urine\ngoes into the urinary bladder throughThe English physician, William Harvey\n(A.D.1578\u20131657), discovered thecirculation of blood. The current\nopinion in those days was that blood\noscillates in the vessels of the body.For his views, Harvey was ridiculed\nand was called \u201ccirculator\u201d. He lost\nmost of his patients. However, beforehe died, Harvey\u2019s idea about\ncirculation was generally accepted as\na biological fact.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 76Sometimes a person\u2019s kidneys may\nstop working due to infection or\ninjury. As a result of kidney failure,\nwaste products start accumulating inthe blood. Such persons cannot\nsurvive unless their blood is filtered\nperiodically through an artificialkidney. This process is called dialysis .tube-like ureters . It is stored in the\nbladder and is passed out through the\nurinary opening at the end of a\nmuscular tube called urethra  (Fig. 7.6).\nThe kindeys, ureters, bladder and\nurethra form the excretory system.\nAn adult human being normally\npasses about 1\u20131.8 L of urine in 24hours. The urine consists of 95% water,\n2.5% urea and 2.5% other wasteproducts.\nWe have all experienced that we sweat\non a hot summer day. The sweat\nPaheli wants to know\nwhether other animals also\nurinate?\nThe way in which waste chemicals\nare removed from the body of the\nanimal depends on the availabilityof water. Aquatic animals like fishes,\nexcrete cell waste as ammonia which\ndirectly dissolves in water. Someland animals like birds, lizards,\nsnakes excrete a semi-solid, white\ncoloured compound (uric acid). Themajor excretory product in humans\nis urea.Fig. 7.6   Human excretory system\nKidney\nUreter\nUrinary bladder\nUrethracontains water and salts. Boojho has\nseen that sometimes in summer, whitepatches are formed on our clothes,\nespecially in areas like underarms.\nThese marks are left by salts present inthe sweat.\nDoes sweat serve any other function?\nWe know that the water kept in anearthen pot ( matka ) is cooler. This is\nbecause the water evaporates from thepores of the pot, which causes cooling.\nUrinary opening\nReprint 2024-25\n\nTRANSPORTATION  IN ANIMALS  AND PLANTS 77\nSimilarly, when we sweat, it helps to cool\nour body.\n7.3 T RANSPORT  OF SUBSTANCES  IN\nPLANTS\nIn Chapter 1 you learnt that plants takewater and mineral nutrients from the soilthrough the roots and transport it to the\nleaves. The leaves prepare food for the\nplant, using water and carbon dioxide\nduring photosynthesis. You also learnt in\nChapter 6 that food is the source of energy\nand every cell of an organism gets energyby the breakdown of glucose. The cells\nuse this energy to carry out vital activitiesof life. Therefore food must be madeavailable to every cell of an organism.\nHave you ever wondered how water and\nnutrients absorbed by the root aretransported to the leaves? How is the\nfood prepared by the leaves carried to\nthe parts which cannot make food?\nTransport of water and\nminerals\nPlants absorb water and minerals by\nthe roots. The roots have root hair.The root hair increase the surface areaof the root for the absorption of waterand mineral nutrients dissolved in\nwater. The root hair is in contact with\nthe water present between the soilparticles [Fig. 7.7 (a)].\nCan you guess how water moves\nfrom the root to the leaves? What kindof transport system is present in plants?\nBoojho thinks that plants\nmay have pipes to transport\nwater to the entire plant like\nwe have in our homes for the\nsupply of water.\n(a)(b)\nXylem vesselsFig. 7.7  Transport of water and minerals in\n(a) a section of root, (b) a treeRoot hair\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 78\nWell, Boojho is right. Plants have\npipe-like vessels to transport water and\nnutrients from the soil. The vessels are\nmade of special cells, forming the\nvascular tissue . A tissue is a group of\ncells that perform specialised function\nin an organism. The vascular tissue for\nthe transport of water and nutrients in theplant is called the xylem [Fig. 7.7 (a)].\nThe xylem forms a continuous\nnetwork of channels that connects rootsto the leaves through the stem and\nbranches and thus transports water to\nthe entire plant [Fig. 7.7 (b)].\nPaheli says her mother puts\nladyfinger and other vegetables in\nwater if they are somewhat dry.\nShe wants to know how water\nenters into them.\nBoojho wants to know why\nplants absorb a large quantity\nof water from the soil, then give\nit off by transpiration!\nFig. 7.8 (a) Stem placed in coloured water\nDoes any part of the herb appear\nred? If yes, how do you think the colourreached there?\nYou can cut the stem across and look\nfor the red colour inside the stem(Fig. 7.8(b) and 7.8(c)).\nFrom this activity we see that water\nmoves up the stem. In other words, stemconducts water. Just like the red ink,minerals dissolved in water also move\nup the stem, along with water. Water\nand minerals go to leaves and otherplant parts, through narrow tubes\n(xylem) inside the stem (Fig. 7.7(b)).You know that leaves synthesise\nfood. The food has to be transported to\nall parts of the plant. This is done by\nthe vascular tissue called the phloem .\nThus, xylem and phloem transport\nsubstances in plants.\nActivity 7.3\nWe would require a glass tumbler, water,\nred ink, a tender herb (e.g., Balsam),\nand a blade for this activity.\nPour water to fill one-third of the\ntumbler. Add a few drops of red ink tothe water. Cut the base of the stem ofthe herb and place it in the glass as shown\nin Fig. 7.8(a). Observe it the next day.\nFig. 7.8 (b) Water moves up in the stem\n(c) Enlarged view of open end of stem(b) (c)\nReprint 2024-25\n\nTRANSPORTATION  IN ANIMALS  AND PLANTS 79\nWhat you have learnt\n\uf06eIn most animals the blood that circulates in the body distributes food\nand oxygen to different cells of the body. It also carries waste productsfrom different parts of the body for excretion.\n\uf06eCirculatory system consists of the heart and blood vessels.\n\uf06eIn humans, blood flows through arteries and veins and the heart actsas a pumping organ.\n\uf06eBlood consists of plasma, RBC, WBC and platelets. Blood is red due tothe presence of a red pigment, haemoglobin.\n\uf06eThe human heart beats about 70\u201380 times per minute in an adultperson.

Not all the waterabsorbed is utilised by the plant. The water\nevaporates through the stomata presenton the surface of the leaves by the process\nof transpiration. The evaporation of waterfrom leaves generates a suction pull (the\nsame that you produce when you suck\nwater through a straw) which canpull water to great heights in the\ntall trees.

These componentsof food are called nutrients  and are\nnecessary for our body.\nAll living organisms require food.\nPlants can synthesise food for\nthemselves  but animals including\nhumans cannot. They get it from plantsor animals that eat plants. Thus,\nhumans and animals are directly or\nindirectly dependent on plants.\n1.1 M ODE OF NUTRITION  IN PLANTS\nPlants are the only organisms that canprepare food for themselves by using\nwater, carbon dioxide and minerals. The\nraw materials are present in theirsurroundings.\nThe nutrients enable living\norganisms to build their bodies, to grow,to repair damaged parts of their bodies\nand provide the energy to carry out life\nprocesses. Nutrition  is the mode of\ntaking food by an organism and itsutilisation by the body. The mode ofnutrition in which organisms make food\nthemselves from simple substances is\ncalled autotrophic (auto = self; trophos\n= nourishment) nutrition. Therefore,\nplants are called autotrophs. Animals\nand most other organisms take in food\nprepared by plants. They are called\nheterotrophs ( heteros = other).\nBoojho wants to know\nhow plants prepare\ntheir own food.\nNow we may ask where the food\nfactories of plants are located: whetherfood is made in all parts of a plant or\nonly in certain parts?

How do they transport\nthem to the food factories of plants?\n1.2 P HOTOSYNTHESIS  \u2014 F OOD\nMAKING PROCESS  IN PLANTS\nLeaves are the food factories of plants.Therefore, all the raw materials must\nreach the leaf. Water and minerals\npresent in the soil are absorbed by the\nroots and transported to the leaves.\nCarbon dioxide from air is taken in\nPaheli wants to know why\nour body cannot make food\nfrom carbon dioxide, water\nand minerals like plants do.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 2\nPaheli wants to know what is so\nspecial about the leaves that they\ncan synthesise food but  other\nparts of the plant cannot.Cells\nthrough the tiny pores present on the\nsurface of leaves. These pores aresurrounded by \u2018guard cells\u2019. Such pores\nare called stomata [Fig. 1.2 (c)].\nWater and minerals are transported\nto the leaves by the vessels which run\nlike pipes throughout the root, the stem,the branches and the leaves. They form\na continuous path or passage for the\nnutrients to reach the leaf. They arecalled vessels. You will learn more about\ntransport of materials in plants in\nChapter 7.The leaves have a green pigment\ncalled chlorophyll . It helps leaves to\ncapture the energy of the sunlight. This\nenergy is used to synthesise (prepare)\nfood from carbon dioxide and water.Since the synthesis of food occurs in the\npresence of sunlight, it is called\nphotosynthesis (Photo: light; synthesis  :\nto combine). So we find that chlorophyll,\nsunlight, carbon dioxide and water are\nnecessary to carry out the process ofphotosynthesis. It is a unique process\non the earth . The solar energy is\ncaptured by the leaves and stored in the\nplant in the form of food. Thus, sun is\nthe ultimate source of energy for allliving organisms.\nCan you imagine life on earth in the\nabsence of photosynthesis!\nIn the absence of photosynthesis\nthere would not be any food. The\nsurvival of almost all living organisms\ndirectly or indirectly depends upon thefood made by the plants. Besides,\noxygen which is essential for the survivalYou have seen that buildings are made of bricks.\nSimilarly, the bodies of living organisms aremade of tiny units called cells. Cells can be seen\nonly under the microscope. Some organismsare made of only one cell. The cell is enclosed bya thin outer boundary, called the cell membrane .\nMost cells have a distinct, centrally locatedspherical structure called the nucleus (Fig. 1.1).The nucleus is surrounded by a jelly-like\nsubstance called cytoplasm .\nCell membraneCytoplasmNucleus\nFig. 1.1 Cell\nBoojho wants to know how water\nand minerals absorbed by roots\nreach the leaves.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nNUTRITION  IN PLANTS 3Besides leaves, photosynthesis also takes place in other green parts of the\nplant \u2014 in green stems and green branches. The desert plants have scale- or\nspine-like leaves to reduce loss of water by transpiration. These plants have\ngreen stems which carry out photosynthesis.\nof all organisms is produced duringphotosynthesis. In the absence ofphotosynthesis, life would be impossible\non the earth.\nDuring photosynthesis, chlorophyll\ncontaining cells of leaves (Fig. 1.2), inthe presence of sunlight, use carbon\ndioxide and water to synthesisecarbohydrates (Fig. 1.3). The process\ncan be represented in an equation:\nDuring the process oxygen is\nreleased. The presence of starch in\nleaves indicates the occurrence of\nphotosynthesis. Starch is also a\ncarbohydrate.\uf02b \uf0be\uf0be\uf0be\uf0be\uf0be\uf0be \uf0ae\n\uf02bsunlight\nchlorophyllCarbon dioxide water \nCarbohydrate oxygen\nBoojho has observed some\nplants with deep red, violet or\nbrown leaves.

These are usedto synthesise other components of food\nsuch as proteins and fats. But proteins\nare nitrogenous substances whichcontain nitrogen. From where do the\nplants obtain nitrogen?\nRecall that nitrogen is present in\nabundance in gaseous form in the air.However, plants cannot absorb nitrogen\nin this form. Soil has certain bacteria thatconvert gaseous nitrogen into a usable\nform and release it into the soil. These\nare absorbed by the plants along withwater. Also, you might have seen farmers\nadding fertilisers rich in nitrogen to the\nsoil. In this way the plants fulfil theirrequirements of nitrogen along with the\nother constituents. Plants can then\nsynthesise proteins and vitamins.\n1.3 O THER MODES OF NUTRITION  IN\nPLANTS\nThere are some plants which do not havechlorophyll. They cannot synthesisefood. How do they survive and from\nwhere do they derive nutrition? Like\nhumans and animals such plantsdepend on the food produced by other\nplants. They use the heterotrophic\nmode of nutrition. Look at Fig. 1.5. Do\nyou see a yellow wiry branched structure\ntwining around the stem and branches\nof a tree? This is a plant called Cuscuta(Amarbel). It does not have chlorophyll.\nIt takes readymade food from the plant\non which it is climbing. The plant onwhich it climbs is called the host. Since\nit deprives the host of valuable nutrients,You often see slimy, green patches\nin ponds or stagnant water bodies. Theseare generally formed by the growth oforganisms called algae. Can you guess\nwhy algae are green in colour? They\ncontain chlorophyll which gives themthe green colour. Algae can also prepare\ntheir own food by photosynthesis.\nSynthesis of plant food other\nthan carbohydrates\nYou have just learnt that plants\nsynthesise carbohydrates through theprocess of photosynthesis.

The large amount of red,brown and other pigments mask thegreen colour (Fig. 1.4). Photosynthesis\ntakes place in these leaves also.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nNUTRITION  IN PLANTS 5Cuscuta is called the parasite . Are we\nand other animals also a kind of\nparasites?

The lid closes\nand the insect is trapped. The insect isdigested by the digestive juices secreted\nin the pitcher and its nutrients are\nabsorbed. Such insect-eating plants arecalled insectivorous plants.\nIs it possible that such plants do not\nget all the required nutrients from thesoil in which they grow?\nFig. 1.5  Cuscuta (Amarbel) on host plant\nPaheli wants to know whether\nmosquitoes, bed bugs, lice and\nleeches that suck our blood are\nalso parasites.\nFig. 1.6  Pitcher plant showing lid and pitcherLeaf modified\ninto pitcherLid\nBoojho is confused. If the\npitcher plant is green and\ncarries out photosynthesis, then\nwhy does it feed on insects?\nHave you seen or heard of plants that\ncan eat animals? There are a few plants\nwhich can trap insects and digest them.Is it not amazing? Such plants may be\ngreen or of some other colour. Look at\nthe plant in Fig. 1.6. The pitcher-like orjug-like structure is the modified part\nof leaf. The apex of the leaf forms a lid\nwhich can open and close the mouth ofthe pitcher.

Let us find out what\ntype of nutrients they need to surviveand from where they get them.\nBoojho wants to know how\nthese organisms acquire\nnutrients. They do not have\nmouths like animals do. They are\nnot like green plants as they lack\nchlorophyll and cannot make food\nby photosynthesis.\nActivity 1.2\nTake a piece of bread and moisten it with\nwater. Leave it in a moist warm place\nfor 2\u20133 days or until fluffy patchesappear on them (Fig. 1.8). What is the\ncolour of these patches? Observe the\npatches under a microscope or amagnifying glass. Write down your\nobservations in the notebook. You will\nsee cotton-like threads spread on thepiece of bread.\nPaheli is keen to know\nwhether her beautiful shoes,\nwhich she wore on special\noccasions, were spoiled by fungi\nduring the rainy season. She\nwants to know how fungi appear\nsuddenly during the rainy\nseason.\nThese organisms are called fungi .\nThey have a different mode of nutrition.They absorb the nutrients from thebread. This mode of nutrition in which\norganisms take in nutrients from dead\nand decaying matter is calledsaprotrophic nutrition . Such organisms\nwith saprotrophic mode of nutrition arecalled saprotrophs .\nFungi also grow on pickles, leather,\nclothes and other articles that are leftin hot and humid weather for long time.During the rainy season they spoil many\nthings.

Do you know why this is done?\nYou learnt that plants absorb\nminerals and nutrients from the soil.So, their amounts in the soil keep ondeclining. Fertilisers and manures\ncontain nutrients such as nitrogen,\npotassium, phosphorous, etc. Thesenutrients need to be added from time\nto time to enrich the soil. We can grow\nplants and keep them healthy ifwe can fulfil the nutrient requirement\nof plants.\nUsually crop plants absorb a lot of\nnitrogen and the soil becomes deficientin nitrogen. You learnt that though\nnitrogen gas is available in plenty in theair, plants cannot use it in the manner\nthey can use carbon dioxide. They need\nnitrogen in a soluble form. Thebacterium called Rhizobium  can take\natmospheric nitrogen and convert it intoa usable form. But Rhizobium cannot\nmake its own food. So it often lives in\nthe roots of gram, peas, moong,  beans\nand other legumes and provides them\nwith nitrogen. In return, the plants\nprovide food and shelter to the\nbacteria. They, thus, have asymbiotic relationship. This association\nis of great significance for the\nfarmers.

Now, can you figure out how we\ncan protect our things from gettingspoiled?\nSome organisms live together and\nshare both shelter and nutrients. Thisrelationship is called symbiosis .

Each group may have a\ndifferent consumption pattern. Are\nthe earlier generations of any group\ntoo greedy?  It may be that the earlier\ngenerations in some groups were\nconcerned about the coming\ngeneration(s) and left something for\nthem.\nIn this chapter we will learn about\nsome exhaustible natural resources\nlike coal, petroleum and natural gas.\nThese were formed from the dead\nremains of living organisms (fossils).\nSo, these are all known as fossil\nfuels.3.1 Coal\nYou may have seen coal or hear d about\nit (Fig. 3.1). It is as hard as stone and is\nblack in colour .\nFig. 3.1: Coal\nCoal is one of the fuels used to cook\nfood. Earlier , it was used in railway\nengines to produce steam to run the\nengine. It is also used in thermal power\nplants to produce electricity. Coal is also\nused as a fuel in various industries.\nStory of Coal\nWhere do we get\ncoal from and how\nis it formed?\nAbout 300 million years ago the\nearth had dense forests in low lying\nwetland areas. Due to natural processes,\nlike flooding, these forests got buried\nunder the soil. As more soil deposited\nover them, they were compressed. The\ntemperature also rose as they sank\ndeeper and deeper . Under high pr essur e\nand high temperature, dead plants got\nslowly converted to coal. As coal\ncontains mainly carbon, the slow\nprocess of conversion of dead vegetation\ninto coal is called carbonisation.\n Since\nit was formed from the remains of\nvegetation, coal is also called a fossil fuel.\nA coal mine is shown in Fig. 3.2.\nCOAL AND PETROLEUM 33\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 34\nFig. 3.2:  A coal mine\nCoal Gas\nCoal gas is obtained during the\nprocessing of coal to get coke.

It is an almost pure form of\ncarbon. Coke is used in the manufacture\nof steel and in the extraction of many\nmetals.\nCoal Tar\nIt is a black, thick liquid (Fig. 3.3) with\nan unpleasant smell. It is a mixture ofabout 200 substances. Products\nobtained from coal tar are used as\nstarting materials for manufacturing\nvarious substances used in everyday\nlife and in industry, like synthetic\ndyes, drugs, explosives, per fumes,\nplastics, paints, photographic materials,\nroofing materials, etc. Interestingly,\nnaphthalene balls used to repel moths\nand other insects are also obtained from\ncoal tar .\n2024-25\n\nCOAL AND PETROLEUM 35as a fuel in many industries situated\nnear the coal processing plants.\n3.2 Petroleum\nYou know that petr ol is used as a fuel in\nlight automobiles such as motor cycles/\nscooters and cars.

The\nword petroleum is derived from petra\n(rock) and oleum (oil) as it is mined\nfrom between the rocks under Earth as\nshown in Fig. 3.4.\nDo you know how petroleum is\nformed?\nPetroleum was formed from\norganisms living in the sea. As these\norganisms died, their bodies settled at\nthe bottom of the sea and got covered\nwith layers of sand and clay.

Hydrogen gas\nobtained from natural gas, is used in\nthe production of fertilisers (urea).\nDue to its great commercial\nimportance, petroleum is also called\n\u2018black gold\u2019.\n3.3 Natural Gas\nNatural gas is a very important fossil\nfuel because it is easy to transport\nthrough pipes. Natural gas is stored\nunder high pressure as compressed\nnatural gas (CNG). CNG is used for\npower generation. It is now being used\nTable 3.1 V arious Constituents of Petr oleum and their Uses\nS.No. Constituents of Petroleum                       Uses\n1.

India has vast\nreserves of natural gas. In our country,\nnatural gas has been found in T ripura,\nRajasthan, Maharashtra and in the\nKrishna Godavari delta.3.4Some Natural Resources\nare Limited\nYou have studied in the beginning of\nthe chapter that some natural resources\nare exhaustible like fossil fuels, forests,\nminerals etc.\nYou know that coal and petr oleum\nare fossil fuels. It required the dead\norganisms millions of years to get\nconverted into these fuels. On the\nother hand, the known reserves of\nthese will last only a few hundred\nyears. Mor eover , bur ning of these\nfuels is a major cause of air pollution.\nTheir use is also linked to global\nwarming. It is therefore necessary that\nwe use these fuels only when\nabsolutely necessary. This will result\nin better environment, smaller risk of\nglobal warming and their availability\nfor a longer period of time.\nIn India, the Petroleum Conservation\nResearch Association (PCRA) advises\npeople how to save petrol/diesel while\ndriving.

            "text": "In the pr evious chapter , you have\nlearnt how animals reproduce. It is\nonly after \u2018growing up\u2019 to a certain\nage that human beings and many other\nanimals can reproduce. Why can\nhumans reproduce only after a certain\nage?\nIn this chapter , you will lear n about\nchanges that take place in the human\nbody after which a person becomes\ncapable of reproduction.\nIn Chapter 6, you \nhave learnt about\nhuman reproductive organs. Here, we\nshall discuss the role that hormones play\nin bringing about changes that make a\nchild grow into an adult.\n7.1 Adolescence and Puberty\nBoojho was celebrating his 12th\nbirthday. After his friends left, Boojho\nand Paheli began chatting with their\nparents. Paheli studies in an all-girls\nschool. She started laughing. She\nremarked that many of Boojho\u2019s  school\nfriends, whom she met after a year , had\nsuddenly shot up in height. Some of\nthem were looking very funny with a\nhairy line above their lips. Her mother\nexplained that the boys had grown up.\nGrowth begins from the day one is\nborn. But upon crossing the age of 10\nor 11, there is a sudden spurt in growth\nwhich becomes noticeable. The changes\ntaking place in the body are part of\ngrowing up. They indicate that you areI wonder how long this\nperiod marked by changes\nin the body will last!\nno longer  a child but are on the way to\nbecoming an adult.\nIt is a strange period of life\nwhen you are neither a child nor\nan adult. I wonder whether this\nperiod between childhood and\nadulthood had a special name!\nGrowing up is a natural process. The\nperiod of life, when the body undergoes\nchanges, leading to reproductive\nmaturity, is called adolescence.\nAdolescence begins around the age of\n11 and lasts upto 18 or 19 years of age.\nSince this period covers the \u2018teens\u2019 (13\nto 18 or 19 years of age), adolescents\nare also called \u2018teenagers\u2019. In girls,\nadolescence may begin a year or two\nearlier than in boys. Also, the period of\nadolescence  varies  from person to person.\nThe human body undergoes several\nchanges during adolescence. These\nchanges mark the onset of puberty . The\nmost important change which marks\npuberty is that boys and girls become\ncapable of reproduction. Puberty ends\nwhen an adolescent reaches reproductive\nmaturity.\nREACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE REACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 80\n% of full height\nBoys Girls\n8 72% 77%\n9 75% 81%\n10 78% 84%\n11 81% 88%\n12 84% 91%\n13 88% 95%\n14 92% 98%\n15 95% 99%\n16 98% 99.5%\n17 99% 100%\n18 100% 100%Age in\nYearsPaheli and Boojho\nrealised that sudden\nincrease in height and\nhairy line above the lips\nin boys were signs of\nadolescence. They\nwanted to know more\nabout other changes at\npuberty.\n7.2 Changes at Puberty\nIncrease in Height\nThe most conspicuous change during\npuberty is the sudden increase in\nheight. At this time the long bones, that\nis, the bones of the arms and the legs\nelongate and make a person tall.\nActivity 7.1\nThe following chart gives the\naverage rate of growth in height of\nboys and girls with age. The figures\nin columns 2 and 3, give the\npercentage of the height a person\nhas reached at the age given in\ncolumn 1. For example, by the age\n11, a boy has reached 81% of his\nprobable full height, while a girl\nhas reached 88% of her full\nheight. These figures are only\nrepresentative and there may be\nindividual variations.\nUse the Table for your friends\nand work out how tall they are likely\nto be. Find out who is likely to beCalculation for full height (cm)\n( )100Presentheight cm\n%of fullheightatthisage\u00d7\n    (as given in the chart)\nExample:\nA boy is 9 years old and 120 cm\ntall. At the end of the growth period\nhe is likely to be\n\u00d712010075 cm = 160 cm tallthe tallest and who might be the\nshortest in your class.\n2024-25\n\nREACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE 81There is no need for Paheli to worry.\nAll parts of the body do not grow at the\nsame rate. Sometimes the arms and legs\nor hands and feet of adolescents look\noversized and out of proportion with the\nbody. But soon the other parts catch\nup and result in a proportionate body.\nYou must have noticed that height\nof an individual is more or less similar\nto that of some family member . This is\nbecause height depends on the genes\ninherited fr om par ents. It is, however ,\nvery important to eat the right kind of\nfood during these growing years. This\nhelps the bones, muscles and other\nparts of the body get adequate\nnourishment for gr owth. Y ou will find\nnutritional needs of adolescents\ndiscussed later in the lesson.\nChange in Body Shape\nHave you noticed that boys in your class\nhave broader shoulders and wider chests\nthan boys in  junior classes? This is\nbecause they have entered the age of\npuberty when shoulders generally\nbroaden as a result of growth. In girls,\nthe region below the waist becomes\nwider .\nIn boys, the muscles of the body grow\nmore prominently than in the girls.\nThus, changes occurring in adolescent\nboys and girls are different.\nVoice Change\nDid you notice that sometimes the voice\nof some of the boys in your class cracks?\nAt puberty, the voice box  or the larynx\nbegins to grow. Boys develop larger voice\nboxes. The growing voice box in boys can\nbe seen as a protruding part of the throatActivity 7.2\nUse the data given in Activity 7.1 to\ndraw a graph. Take age on the\nX-axis and per cent growth in height\non the Y-axis. Highlight the point\nrepresenting your age on the graph.\nFind out the percentage of height\nyou have already reached. Calculate\nthe height you might eventually\nreach. Tally your graph with the one\ngiven here (Fig. 7.1).\nFig. 7.1 : Graph showing percentage of height\nwith age\nI am worried. Though I\nhave become taller , my\nface looks much smaller\ncompared to my body.\nInitially, girls grow faster than boys\nbut by about 18 years of age, both reach\ntheir maximum height. The rate of\ngrowth in height varies in different\nindividuals. Some may grow suddenly\nat puberty and then slow down, while\nothers may grow gradually.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 82and pimples on the face at this time\nbecause of the increased activity of these\nglands in the skin.\nDevelopment of Sex Organs\nLook up Fig. 6.1 and 6.3 of the\nprevious lesson which show sex\norgans of humans. At puberty, male\nsex organs like the testes and penis\ndevelop completely. The testes also\nbegin to produce sperms. In girls, the\novaries enlarge and eggs begin to\nmature. Also ovaries start releasing\nmature eggs.\nReaching Mental, Intellectual and\nEmotional Maturity\nAdolescence is also a period of change\nin a person\u2019s way of thinking.\nAdolescents are more independent than\nbefore and are also self conscious.\nIntellectual development takes place and\nthey tend to spend considerable time\nthinking. In fact, it is often the time in\none\u2019s life when the brain has the\ngreatest capacity for learning.\nSometimes, however , an adolescent may\nfeel insecure while trying to adjust to\nthe changes in the body and mind. But\nas adolescent learners, you should know\nthat there is no reason to feel insecure.\nThese changes are a natural part of\ngrowing up.\n7.3 Secondary Sexual\nCharacters\nYou have lear nt in Chapter 6, that\ntestes and ovaries are the reproductive\norgans. They produce the gametes,\nthat is, sperms and ova. In girls,\nbreasts begin to develop at pubertyMany of my classmates\nhave a hoarse voice. Now I\nknow why?\nFig. 7.2 : Adam\u2019s apple in a grown up boycalled Adam\u2019s apple  (Fig. 7.2). In girls,\nthe larynx is hardly visible from the\noutside because of its small size.\nGenerally, girls have a high pitched voice,\nwhereas boys have a deep voice. In\nadolescent boys, sometimes, the muscles\nof the growing voice box go out of control\nand the voice becomes hoarse. This state\nmay remain for a few days or weeks after\nwhich the voice becomes normal.\nA few glands such as sweat glands,\noil glands and salivary glands release\ntheir secretions through ducts.\nEndocrine glands release hormones\ndirectly into the bloodstream. So, they\nare also termed ductless glands.Increased Activity of Sweat and\nSebaceous Glands\nDuring puberty the secretion of sweat\nglands and sebaceous glands (oil glands)\nincreases. Many young people get acneAdam\u2019s\napple\n2024-25\n\nREACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE 83and boys begin to gr ow facial hair , that\nis, moustaches and beard. As these\nfeatures help to distinguish the male\nfrom the female they are called\nsecondary sexual characters . Boys\nalso develop hair on their chest. In\nboth, boys and girls, hair grows under\nthe arms and in the region above the\nthighs or the pubic region.\nPaheli and Boojho have now\nunderstood that puberty marks the\nbeginning of the reproductive period\nwhen one becomes capable of\nreproduction. But they want to know\nif reproductive life, once begun,\ncontinues, or it ends some time.The testes and ovaries secrete sex\nhormones. Y ou have just lear nt that\nthese hormones are responsible for the\nmale and female secondary sexual\ncharacters. Further , the sex hor mones\nare under the control of hormones from\nthe pituitary gland (Fig. 7.3). The\npituitary secretes many hormones, one\nof which makes ova mature in the\novaries and sperms form in the testes.\nBoth Boojho and Paheli wish to know\nwhat initiates changes at puberty.\nFig. 7.3 : The onset of puberty is controlled by\nhormonesThe changes which occur at\nadolescence are controlled by\nhormones. Hormones are chemical\nsubstances. These are secretions from\nendocrine glands , or endocrine system.\nThe male hormone or testosterone\nbegins to be released by the testes at\nthe onset of puberty. This causes\nchanges in boys about which you have\njust learnt, for example, the growth of\nfacial hair . Once puberty is r eached in\ngirls, ovaries begin to produce the female\nhormone\n or estrogen which makes the\nbreasts develop. Milk secreting glands\nor mammary glands develop inside the\nbreasts. The production of these\nhormones is under the control of\nanother hormone secreted from an\nendocrine gland called pituitary gland .\n7.4 Role of Hormones in\nInitiating Reproductive\nFunction\nEndocrine glands release hormones\ninto the bloodstream to reach a\nparticular body part called target site .\nThe target site responds to the\nhormone. There are many endocrine\nglands  or ductless glands in the body.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 847.5 Reproductive Phase of\nLife in Humans\nAdolescents become capable of\nreproduction when their testes and\novaries begin to produce gametes. The\ncapacity for maturation  and production\nof gametes lasts for a much longer time\nin males than in females.\nIn females, the reproductive phase of\nlife begins at puberty (10 to 12 years of\nage) and generally lasts till the age of\napproximately 45 to 50 years. The ova\nbegin to mature with the onset of\npuberty. One ovum matures and is\nreleased by one of the ovaries once in\nabout 28 to 30 days. During this\nperiod, the wall of the uterus becomes\nthick so as to receive the egg, in case\nit is fertilised and begins to develop.\nThis results in pregnancy. If\nfertilisation does not occur , the\nreleased egg, and the thickened lining\nof the uterus along with its blood\nvessels are shed off. This causes\nbleeding in women which is called\nmenstruation . Menstruation occurs\nonce in about 28 to 30 days. The first\nmenstrual flow begins at puberty  and\nis termed menarche . At 45 to 50 years\nof age, the menstrual cycle stops.\nStoppage of menstruation is termed\nmenopause.  Initially, menstrual cycle\nmay be irr egular . It take some time to\nbecome r egular .Menstrual cycle is controlled by\nhormones. The cycle includes the\nmaturation of the egg, its release,\nthickening of uterine wall and its\nbreakdown if pregnancy does not\noccur . In case the egg is fertilised it\nbegins to divide and then gets\nembedded in the uterus for further\ndevelopment as you have learnt in\nChapter 6 (Fig. 6.8).\n7.6 How is the Sex of the\nBaby Determined?\nI heard my mother and my\naunt talking about my cousin\nwho is going to have a baby.\nThey were discussing whether\nshe would give birth to a boy\nor a girl. I wonder what makes\nthe fertilised egg develop\neither into a boy or a girl!\nPaheli says that the\nreproductive life of a\nwoman lasts from\nmenarche to menopause.\nIs she right?Boy or Girl?\nInside the fertilised egg or zygote is the\ninstruction for determining the sex of\nthe baby. This instruction is present in\nthe thread-like structures, called\nchromosomes  in the fertilised egg.\nChromosomes are present inside the\nnucleus of every cell. All human beings\nhave 23 pairs of chromosomes in the\nnuclei of their cells. Two chromosomes\nout of these are the sex chromosomes,\nnamed X and Y . A female has two X\nchromosomes, while a male has one X\nand one Y chromosome. The gametes\n(egg and sperm) have only one set of\nchromosomes. The unfertilised egg\nalways has one X chromosome. But\n2024-25\n\nREACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE 85sperms are of two kinds. One kind has\nan X chromosome, and the other kind\nhas a Y chromosome.\nSee Fig. 7.4. When a sperm\ncontaining X chromosome fertilises the\negg, the zygote would have two X\nchromosomes and develop into a female\nchild. If the sperm contributes a Y\nchromosome to the egg (ovum) at\nfertilisation, the zygote would develop\ninto a male child.and ovaries to produce their hormones.\nYou have alr eady lear nt that the\npituitary gland is an endocrine gland.\nIt is attached to the brain.\nApart from the pituitary, the testes\nand the ovaries, there are other\nendocrine glands in the body such as\nthyroid, pancreas and adrenals\n(Fig. 7.5).\nFig. 7.4 : Sex determination in humansboy girlsperms\neggs\nNow you know that the sex\nchromosomes of the father determine the\nsex of an unborn baby. The belief that\nthe mother is responsible for the sex of\nher baby is completely wrong and to\nblame her for this is totally unjustified.\n7.7 Hormones other than\nSex Hormones\nLook at Fig. 7.3 again. The hormones\nsecreted by the pituitary stimulate testesFig. 7.5 :Position of endocrine glands in the\nhuman body\npituitary\ngland\nthyroid gland\nadrenal\ngland\npancreas\ntestisposition of\nthe ovary in\nthe female\nBoojho and Paheli had once visited\ntheir aunt who was a doctor and\nremembered that a boy named Kaka had\na very big and bulging throat. Their aunt\nhad told them that Kaka was suffering\nfrom \u2018goitre\u2019, a disease of the thyroid\ngland . Kaka\u2019s thyroid gland was not\nproducing the hormone thyroxine .\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 86Their aunt also told them that their\nuncle was suffering from \u2018diabetes\u2019\nbecause his pancreas was not producing\nthe hormone insulin  in sufficient\nquantities. Boojho and Paheli then\nasked their aunt about the adrenal\nglands, which are also shown in the\nchart hung on the wall of her clinic. The\naunt told them that adrenal glands\nsecrete hormones which maintain the\ncorrect salt balance in the blood.\nAdrenals also produce the hormone\nadrenalin. It helps the body to adjust\nto stress when one is very angry,\nembarrassed or worried.\nThyroid and adrenals secrete their\nhormones when they receive orders from\nthe pituitary through its hormones.\nPituitary also secretes growth hormone\nwhich is necessary for the normal\ngrowth of a person.controlled by insect hormones.  In a\nfrog, it is controlled by thyroxine, the\nhormone produced by thyroid.\nThyroxine production requires the\npresence of iodine in water . If the water\nin which the tadpoles are growing does\nnot contain sufficient iodine, the\ntadpoles cannot become adults.\n7.8 Role of Hormones in\nCompleting the Life\nHistory of Insects and\nFrogs\nYou have alr eady lear nt about the life\ncycle of the frog. The tadpole passes\nthrough certain stages to become a frog\n(Chapter 6). This change from larva to\nadult is called metamorphosis\n(Fig. 6.10). Metamorphosis in insects isCollect information from magazines\nor from doctors and prepare a note\non the importance of consuming\niodised salt. Y ou can also look for\nthis information on the internet.\n7.9 Reproductive Health\nThe physical and mental well being of\nan individual is regarded as an\nindividual\u2019s health. To keep the body\nhealthy, every human being, at any age,\nneeds to have a balanced diet. The\nperson must also observe personal\nhygiene and undertake adequate\nphysical exercise.\nDuring adolescence, however , these\nbecome even more essential as the body\nis growing.\nNutritional Needs of the Adolescents\nAdolescence is a stage of rapid growth\nand development. Hence the diet for an\nAre there hormones in\nother animals also? Have\nthey any role to play in\nreproduction?\nIf people do not have\nenough iodine in their diet,\nwill they get goitre caused\nby lack of thyroxine?\nActivity 7.3\n2024-25\n\nREACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE 87adolescent has to be carefully planned.\nYou have alr eady lear nt what a balanced\ndiet is. Recall that a balanced diet means\nthat the meals include proteins,\ncarbohydrates, fats and vitamins in\nrequisite proportions. Our Indian meal\nof roti/rice,  dal (pulses) and vegetables\nis a balanced meal. Milk is a balanced\nfood in itself. Fruits also provide\nnourishment. For infants, mother\u2019s milk\nprovides all the nourishment that\nthey need.\nIron builds blood and iron-rich food\nsuch as leafy vegetables, jaggery, meat,\ncitrus, Indian gooseberry (amla)  are good\nfor adolescents.\nCheck items for lunch and dinner in\nyour meal. Is the meal balanced and\nnutritious? Does it include cereals\nwhich give energy and milk, meat, nuts\nand pulses which provide proteins for\ngrowth? Also, does it include fats and\nsugar that give energy? What about\nfruits and vegetables which are\nprotective foods? Chips and packed or\ntinned snacks, though very tasty\nshould never replace regular meals as\nthey do not have adequate nutritional\nvalue.\nActivity 7.4\nMake a group with your friends.\nWrite down the items of food in your\nbreakfast, lunch and dinner you\nhad on the previous day. Identify\nthe items responsible for proper\ngrowth. Also identified the  junk\nfood that you consumed the\nprevious day.Personal Hygiene\nEveryone should have a bath at least\nonce everyday. It is more necessary for\nteenagers because the increased activity\nof sweat glands sometimes makes the\nbody smelly. All parts of the body should\nbe washed and cleaned everyday. If\nmeat\nvegetables\nfruitsmilk and\neggs\ngrains\nFig. 7.6 : Nutritious items of foodActivity 7.5\nGet ideas from the pictures given in\nFig.7.6. Prepare charts or posters\nand paste them in the class so that\nyou are aware of the diet for\nadolescents. Y ou may use your\ncreative ideas and present it like an\nadvertisement. Y ou may even\norganise a competition on this topic.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 88cleanliness is not maintained there are\nchances of catching bacterial  infection.\nGirls  should take special care of\ncleanliness during the time of menstrual\nflow. They should keep track of their\nmenstrual cycle and be prepared for the\nonset of menstruation. Use sanitary\nnapkin or clean homemade pads.\nChange pads after every 4\u20135 hours as\nper the requirement.\nPhysical exercise\nWalking and playing in fresh air keeps\nthe body fit and healthy. All young boys\nand girls should take walks, exercise\nand play outdoor games.Activity 7.6\nCollect data on the number of\nchildren in your class who exercise\nregularly and who do not exercise\nregularly. Did you notice any\ndifference in their fitness and\nhealth? Prepare a report on the\nbenefits of regular exercise.\nSay \u201cNO\u201d to Drugs\nAdolescence is a period of much\nactivity in the body and mind which\nis a normal part of growing up. So do\nnot feel confused or insecure. If\nanybody suggests that you will get\nrelief if you take some drugs, just say\n\u2018No\u2019 unless pr escribed by the doctor .\nDrugs are addictive. If you take them\nonce, you feel like taking them again\nand again. They harm the body in the\nlong run. They ruin health and\nhappiness.\nYou must have hear d about AIDS\nwhich is caused by a dangerous virus,\nHIV. This virus can pass on to a\nnormal person from an infected\nperson by sharing the syringes used\nfor injecting drugs. It can also be\ntransmitted to an infant from the\ninfected  mother through her milk. The\nvirus  can also be transmitted through\nsexual contact with a person infected\nwith HIV .\nAdolescent Pregnancy\nYou might be knowing that in our country, the legal age for marriage is 18 years\nfor girls and 21 years for boys. This is because teenage mothers are not prepared\nmentally or physically for motherhood. Early marriage and motherhood cause health\nproblems in the mother and the child. It also curtails employment opportunities for\nthe young woman and may cause mental agony as she is not ready for\nresponsibilities of motherhood.Myths, Taboos, Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts\nYou have lear nt her e and fr om Chapter\n6 the scientific facts related to human\nreproduction. There are many wrong\nnotions which you should now be able\nto discard as informed adolescents. For\nexample, there are myths and taboos\nregarding bodily changes that\nadolescents experience. Some of these\nare given below and you can now argue\nwhy these are myths and not facts.\n1.A girl becomes pregnant if\nshe looks at boys during\nmenstruation.\n2.The mother is responsible for the\nsex of her child.\n3.A girl should not be allowed to\nwork in the kitchen during\nmenstruation.\nYou may come acr oss many other myths\nand taboos.

Can you name a few fuels\nused in our homes? Name a few fuels\nused in trade and industry. What fuels\nar\ne used for running automobiles? Y our\nlist will contain fuels like cowdung,\nwood, coal, charcoal, petrol, diesel,\ncompressed natural gas (CNG), etc.\nYou ar e familiar with the bur ning of a\ncandle. What is the difference between the\nburning of a candle and the burning of a\nfuel like coal? May be you were able to\nguess right: candle burns with a flame\nwhereas coal does not. Similarly, you will\nfind many other materials burning\nwithout a flame. Let us study the chemical\nprocess of burning and the types of flame\nproduced during this process.\n4.1 What is Combustion?\nRecall the activity of burning of\nmagnesium ribbon per formed in\nClass VII. W e lear nt that magnesium\nburns to form magnesium oxide and\nproduces heat and light (Fig. 4.1).\nWe can per form a similar activity with\na piece of charcoal. Hold the piece with\na pair of tongs and bring it near the\nflame of a candle or a  Bunsen bur ner.\nWhat do you observe?\nWe find that char coal bur ns in air .\nWe know that coal, too, bur ns  in air\nproducing carbon dioxide, heat and\nlight.We wer e told that\nfood is a fuel for\nour body.\nFig. 4.1 : Burning of magnesium\nA chemical process in which a\nsubstance reacts with oxygen to give\noff heat is called combustion . The\nsubstance that undergoes combustion\nis said to be combustible. It is also called\na fuel. The fuel may be solid, liquid or\ngas. Sometimes, light is also given off\nduring combustion, either as a flame or\nas a glow.\nIn the reactions mentioned\nabove magnesium and charcoal are\ncombustible substances.\n2024-25\n\nActivity  4.2\n(Caution : Be careful while handling\nburning candle).\nFix a lighted candle on a table. Put\na glass chimney over the candle and\nrest it on a few wooden blocks in\nsuch a way that air can enter the\nTable 4.1: Combustible and Non-\ncombustible Substances\nMaterial Combustible Non-\ncombustible\nWood\nPaper\nIron nails\nKerosene oil\nStone piece\nStraw\nCharcoal\nMatchsticks\nGlassActivity 4.1\nCollect some materials like straw,\nmatchsticks, ker osene oil, paper ,\niron nails, stone pieces, glass etc.\nUnder the supervision of your\nteacher  try to burn each of these\nmaterials one by one. If combustion\ntakes place mark the material\ncombustible , otherwise mark it\nnon-combustible  (Table 4.1).(a) (b)    (c)\nFig. 4.2: Experiment to show that air is\nessential for burning\nRightly so. In our body\nfood is broken down by\nreaction with oxygen and\nheat is pr oduced. W e\nlearnt that in Class VII.\nCan you name some more\nsubstances which ar e combustible? Y ou\ncan add  those to Table 4.1.\nLet us investigate conditions under\nwhich combustion takes place.\nCOMBUSTION  AND FLAME 41chimney [Fig. 4.2(a)]. Observe what\nhappens to the flame. Now remove\nthe blocks and let the chimney rest\non the table [Fig. 4.2(b)]. Again\nobserve the flame. Finally, put a\nglass plate over the chimney [Fig.\n4.2(c)]. W atch the flame again. What\nhappens in the three cases? Does\nthe flame flicker off? Does it flicker\nand give  smoke? Does it burn\nunaffected? Can you infer anything\nat all about the role played by air in\nthe process of burning?\nWe find that for combustion, air is\nnecessary. The candle burns freely in\ncase (a) when air can enter the\nchimney from below. In case (b), when\nair does not enter the chimney from\nbelow, the flame flickers and produces\nsmoke. In case (c), the flame finally\ngoes off because the air is not\navailable.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 42Activity  4.3\nPlace a piece of burning wood or\ncharcoal on an iron plate or Tawa .\nCover it with a glass jar or a\ntumbler , or a transpar\nent plastic jar .\nObserve what happens. Does\ncharcoal stop burning after\nsometime? Can you think of the\nreason why it stops burning?\nYou might have hear d that when the\nclothes of a person catch fire, the personWe have r ead that the sun\nproduces its own heat and\nlight. Is it also some kind of\ncombustion?\nIn the sun, heat and light are\nproduced by nuclear r eactions. Y ou\nwill learn about this process in higher\nclasses.\nDuring extreme heat\nof summer , at some\nplaces dry grass\ncatches fire. From\nthe grass, it spreads\nto trees, and very\nsoon the whole forest\nis on fire (Fig. 4.4). It\nis very difficult to\ncontrol such fires.\nFig. 4.4 : Forest fireFig. 4.3 : Blanket wrapped around a person\nwhose clothes caught fire\nNow recall some of your experiences.\nDoes a matchstick burn by itself?\nHow does it burn?\nYou must have had an experience of\nburning a piece of paper . Does it bur n\nwhen a burning matchstick is brought\nnear it?\nCan you burn a piece of wood by\nbringing a lighted matchstick near it?\nWhy do you have to use paper or\nkerosene oil to start fire in wood or coal?\nHave you heard of forest fires?is covered with a blanket to extinguish\nfire (Fig. 4.3). Can you guess why?\n2024-25\n\nCOMBUSTION  AND FLAME 43We find that a combustible substance\ncannot catch fire or burn as long as its\ntemperature is lower than its ignition\ntemperature. Have you ever seen\ncooking oil catching fire when a frying\npan is kept for long on a burning stove?\nKerosene oil and wood do not catch fire\non their own at room temperature. But,\nif kerosene oil is heated a little, it will\ncatch fire. But if wood is heated a little,\nit would still not catch fire. Does it mean\nthat ignition temperature of kerosene oil\nis lower than that of wood? Does it mean\nthat we need to take special care in\nstoring kerosene oil? The following\nactivity shows that it is essential for a\nsubstance to reach ignition temperature\nto burn.\nActivity 4.4\n(Caution : Be careful while handling\nburning candle).\nMake two paper cups by folding a\nsheet of paper . Pour about 50 mL of\nwater in one of the cups. Heat both\nthe cups separately with a candle\n(Fig. 4.5). What do you observe?The history of the matchstick is very\nold. More than five thousand years\nago small pieces of pinewood dipped\nin sulphur were used as matches in\nancient Egypt. The modern safety\nmatch was developed only about two\nhundred years ago.\nA mixture of antimony trisulphide,\npotassium chlorate and white\nphosphorus with some glue and\nstarch was applied on the head of a\nmatch made of suitable wood. When\nstruck against a rough surface, white\nphosphorus got ignited due to the heat\nof friction. This started the\ncombustion of the match. However ,\nwhite phosphorus proved to be\ndangerous both for the workers\ninvolved in the manufacturing of\nmatches and for the users.\nThese days the head of the safety\nmatch contains only antimony\ntrisulphide and potassium chlorate.\nThe rubbing surface has powdered\nglass and a little red phosphorus\n(which is much less dangerous).\nWhen the match is struck against\nthe rubbing surface, some red\nphosphorus gets converted into white\nphosphorus. This immediately reacts\nwith potassium chlorate in the\nmatchstick head to produce enough\nheat to ignite antimony trisulphide\nand start the combustion.Do these experiences tell you that\ndifferent substances catch fire at\ndifferent temperatures?\nThe lowest temperature at which a\nsubstance catches fire is called its\nignition temperature.\nCan you tell now why a matchstick\ndoes not catch fire on its own at room\ntemperature? Why does the matchstick\nstart burning on rubbing it on the side\nof the matchbox?\nFig. 4.5 :  Heating water in a paper cup\nwater\npaper\ncups\nWhat happens to the empty paper\ncup? What happens to the paper cup\nwith water? Does water in this cup\nbecome hot?\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 44If we continue heating\nthe cup, we can even boil\nwater in the paper cup.\nCan you think of an\nexplanation for this\nphenomenon?\nThe heat supplied to\nthe paper cup is\ntransferred to water by\nconduction. So, in the\npresence of water , the\nignition temperature of\npaper is not reached.\nHence, it does not burn.\nThe substances which\nhave very low ignition\ntemperature and can\neasily catch fire with\na flame are called\ninflammable substances . Examples of\ninflammable substances are petrol,\nalcohol, Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG)\netc. Can you list some more inflammable\nsubstances?\n4.2How Do W e Contr ol Fir e?\nYou must have seen or hear d of fir e\nbreaking out in homes, shops and\nfactories. If you have seen such an\naccident, write a short description in\nyour note book. Also, share the\nexperience with your classmates.\nIt is important that all of us\nknow the telephone numbers\nof the fire service.Fig. 4.6: Firemen extinguish the fire by throwing water under pressure\nFind out the telephone number of the\nfire service in your area. If a fire\nbreaks out in your house or in your\nneighbourhood, the first thing to do\nis to call the fire service.Does your city/town have a fire\nbrigade station?\nWhen a fire brigade arrives, what\ndoes it do? It pours water on the fire\n(Fig. 4 .6). W ater cools the combustible\nmaterial so that its temperature is\nbrought below its ignition\ntemperature. This prevents the fire\nfrom spr eading. W ater vapour s also\nsurround the combustible material,\nhelping in cutting of f the supply of air .\nSo, the fire is extinguished.\nYou have lear\nnt that ther e are three\nessential requirements for producing\nfire. Can you list these requirements?\nThese are: fuel, air (to supply\noxygen) and heat (to raise the\ntemperature of the fuel beyond the\nignition temperature). Fire can be\ncontrolled by removing one or more of\nthese requirements. The job of a fire\nextinguisher is to cut off the supply of\nair, or to bring down the temperatur e\nof the fuel, or both. Notice that the fuel\n2024-25\n\nCOMBUSTION  AND FLAME 45The most common fire\nextinguisher is water . But\nwater works only when\nthings like wood and paper\nare on fire. If electrical\nequipment is on fire, water\nmay conduct electricity\nand harm those trying to\ndouse the fir e. W ater is\nalso not suitable for fires\ninvolving oil and petrol. Do\nyou recall that water is\nheavier than oil? So, it\nsinks below the oil, and oil\nkeeps burning on the top.\nFor fires involving electrical equipment and inflammable materials like\npetrol, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the best extinguisher . CO2, being heavier than\noxygen, covers the fire like a blanket. Since the contact between the fuel and\noxygen is cut off, the fire is controlled. The added advantage of CO2 is that in\nmost cases it does not harm the electrical equipment.\nHow do we get the supply of carbon dioxide? It can be stored at high pressure\nas a liquid in cylinders. In what form is the LPG stored in cylinders? When\nreleased fr om the cylinder , CO2 expands enor mously in volume and cools down.\nSo, it not only forms a blanket around the fire, it also brings down the\ntemperatur e of the fuel. That is why it is an excellent fir e extinguisher . Another\nway to get CO2 is to release a lot of dry powder of chemicals like sodium\nbicarbonate (baking soda) or potassium bicarbonate. Near the fire, these\nchemicals give off CO2.\nCAUTION  : Do not handle the gas\nstove yourself. Ask your parents\nto help.\nFig. 4.7 :  Fire extinguisher\nin most cases cannot be eliminated.\nIf, for instance, a building catches fire,\nthe whole building is the fuel.\n4.3Types of Combustion\nBring a burning matchstick or a gas\nlighter near a gas stove in the kitchen.\nTurn on the knob of the gas stove. What\ndo you observe?We find that the gas bur ns rapidly\nand produces heat and light. Such\ncombustion is known as rapid\ncombustion .\nThere are substances like\nphosphorus which burn in air at room\ntemperature.\nThe type of combustion in which\na material suddenly bursts into\nflames, without the application of any\napparent cause is called \nspontaneous\ncombustion.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 46\nSpontaneous combustion of coal dust\nhas resulted in many disastrous fires\nin coal mines. Spontaneous forest\nfires are sometimes due to the heat\nof the sun or due to lightning strike.\nHowever , most for est fir es ar e due to\nthe carelessness of human beings. It\nis important to remember that the\ncampfires must be completely\nextinguished before leaving a forest\nafter a picnic, or a visit.\nWe generally have fir eworks on\nfestival days. When a cracker is ignited,\na sudden reaction takes place with the\nevolution of heat, light and sound. A\nlarge amount of gas formed in the\nreaction is liberated. Such a reaction is\ncalled explosion.  Explosion can also take\nplace if pressure is applied on the\ncracker .\n4.4Flame\nObserve an LPG flame. Can you tell the\ncolour of the flame. What is the colour\nof a candle flame?\nRecall your experience of burning a\nmagnesium ribbon in Class VII. If you\ndo not have experience of burning the\nremaining items in Table 4.2 you can\ndo that now.\nTable 4.2  Materials forming Flame on Burning\nS.No. Material Forms flame Does not form flame\n1.

Bring a lighted\nmatchstick near the other end of the\nglass tube. Do you see a flame\ncaught at this end of the glass tube\nafter a while? If so, what is it that\nproduces a flame? Notice that the wax\nnear the heated wick melts quickly.\nThe substances which vapourise\nduring burning, give flames. For\nexample, kerosene oil and molten wax\nrise through the wick and are vapourised\nduring burning and form flames.\nCharcoal, on the other hand, does not\nvapourise and so does not produce a\nflame. In Activity 4.5, could the vapours\nof wax coming out of the glass tube be\nthe cause of the flame produced?\nFig. 4.10\nFig. 4.12When the candle flame is steady,\nintroduce a clean glass plate/slide into\nthe luminous zone of the flame\n(Fig. 4.11). Hold it there with a pair of\ntongs for about 10 seconds. Then\nremove it. What do you observe?Fig. 4.11\nA circular blackish ring is formed on\nthe glass plate/slide. It indicates the\ndeposition of unburnt carbon particles\npresent in the luminous zone of the\nflame.\nHold a thin long copper wire just\ninside the non-luminous zone of flame\nfor about 30 seconds (Fig. 4.12).\nNotice that the portion of the copper\nwire just outside the flame gets red hot.\nDoes it indicate that the non-luminous\nzone of the flame has a high\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 48\nFig. 4.14 : Goldsmith blowing through a\nmetallic pipe4.6What is a Fuel?\nRecall that the sources of heat energy\nfor domestic and industrial purposes\nare mainly wood, charcoal, petrol,\nkerosene etc. These substances are\ncalled fuels. A good fuel is one which is\nreadily available. It is cheap. It burns\neasily in air at a moderate rate. It\nproduces a large amount of heat. It does\nnot leave behind any undersirable\nsubstances.\nThere is probably no fuel that could\nbe consider ed as an ideal fuel . We\nshould look for a fuel which fulfils most\nof the requirements for a particular use.\nFuels differ in their cost. Some fuels\nare cheaper than others.\nMake a list of fuels familiar to you.\nGroup them as solid, liquid and gaseous\nfuels as in Table 4.3.\n4.7Fuel Efficiency\nSuppose you were asked to boil a given\nquantity of water using cow dung, coal\nand LPG as fuel. Which fuel would you\nprefer? Give your r\neason. Y ou may take\nthe help of your parents. Do these three\nfuels produce the same amount of heat?\nThe amount of heat energy produced on\ncomplete combustion of 1 kg of a fuel is\ncalled its calorific value. The calorific\nvalue of a fuel is expressed in a unitFig. 4.13 : Different zones of candle flame\nTable 4.3 : Types of Fuels\n S. No. Solid Fuels Liquid Fuels Gaseous Fuels\n1.

In fact, this part of the\nflame is the hottest part (Fig. 4.13).\nGoldsmiths blow the outermost zone\nof a flame with a metallic blow-pipe for\nmelting gold and silver (Fig. 4.14). Why\ndo they use the outermost zone of the\nflame?\n2024-25\n\nCOMBUSTION  AND FLAME 49\nparticles. These fine particles are\ndangerous pollutants causing\nrespiratory diseases, such as asthma.\n2.Incomplete combustion of these\nfuels gives carbon monoxide gas. It is a\nvery poisonous gas. It is dangerous to\nburn coal in a closed room. The carbon\nmonoxide gas produced can kill persons\nsleeping in that room.\nFor centuries, wood was used as\ndomestic and industrial fuel. But now\nit has been replaced by coal and other\nfuels like LPG. In many rural parts of\nour country, people still use wood as a\nfuel because of its easy availability and\nlow cost. However , burning of wood gives\na lot of smoke which is very harmful for\nhuman beings. It causes respiratory\nproblem. Also, trees provide us with\nuseful substances which are lost when\nwood is used as fuel. Moreover cutting\nof trees leads to deforestation  which is\nquite harmful to the environment, as\nyou learnt in Class VII.Table 4.4 : Calorific V alues of dif ferent\nFuels\nFuel Calorific V alue\n(kJ/kg)\nCow dung cake 6000-8000\nWood 17000-22000\nCoal 25000-33000\nPetrol 45000\nKerosene 45000\nDiesel 45000\nMethane 50000\nCNG 50000\nLPG 55000\nBiogas 35000-40000\nHydrogen 150000\nOh! So, that is why we are\nadvised never to sleep in a\nroom with burning or\nsmouldering coal fire in it.\nBurning of Fuels Leads to Harmful\nProducts\nThe increasing fuel consumption has\nharmful effects on the environment.\n1.Carbon fuels like wood, coal,\npetroleum release unburnt carbon3.Combustion of most fuels releases\ncarbon dioxide in the environment.\nIncreased concentration of carbon\ndioxide in the air is believed to cause\nglobal warming .\nGlobal warming is the rise in\ntemperature of the atmosphere  of the\nearth. This results , among other things,\nin the melting of polar glaciers , which\nleads to a rise in the sea level, causing\nfloods in the coastal areas . Low lying\ncoastal areas may even be permanently\nsubmer ged under water .\n4.Burning of coal and diesel releases\nsulphur dioxide gas. It is an extremely\nsuffocating and corr osive gas. Mor eover ,\npetrol engines give off  gaseous oxides\nof nitrogen. Oxides of sulphur and\nnitrogen dissolve in rain water and form\nacids. Such rain is called acid rain . It is\nvery harmful for crops, buildings\nand soil.\nThe use of diesel and petrol as fuels\nin automobiles is being replaced by\nCNG (Compressed Natural Gas), because\nCNG produces the harmful  products in\nvery small amounts. CNG is a cleaner fuel.called  kilojoule per kg  (kJ/kg).\nCalorific values of some fuels are given\nin Table 4.4.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 50\n KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS\nACID RAIN\nCALORIFIC V ALUE\nCOMBUSTION\nDEFOREST ATION\nEXPLOSION\nFLAME\nFIRE EXTINGUISHER\nFUEL\nFUEL EFFICIENCY\nGLOBAL WARMING\nIDEAL FUEL\nIGNITION\nTEMPERA TURE\nINFLAMMABLE\nSUBST ANCES WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\n\u00dcThe substances which burn in air are called\ncombustible.\n\u00dcOxygen (in air) is essential for combustion.\n\u00dcDuring the process of combustion, heat and\nlight are given out.\n\u00dcIgnition temperature is the lowest temperature\nat which a combustible substance catches\nfire.\n\u00dcInflammable substances have very low\nignition temperature.\n\u00dcFire can be controlled by removing one or more\nrequirements essential for producing fire.\n\u00dcWater is commonly used to contr ol fires.\n\u00dcWater cannot be used to contr ol fires involving\nelectrical equipment or oils.\n\u00dcThere are various types of combustions such\nas rapid combustion, spontaneous\ncombustion, explosion, etc.\n\u00dcThere are three different zones of a flame -\ndark zone, luminous zone and non-luminous\nzone.\n\u00dcAn ideal fuel is cheap, readily available, readily\ncombustible and easy to transport.

How is seeing made possible?\n13.1 What makes Things\nVisible\nHave you ever thought how we see\nvarious objects? Y ou may say that  eyes\nsee the objects. But, can you see an\nobject in the dark? It means that eyes\nalone cannot see any object. It is only\nwhen light from an object enters our\neyes that we see the object. The light\nmay have been emitted by the object, or\nmay have been reflected by it.\nYou lear nt in Class VII that a polished\nor a shiny sur face can act as a mirr or. A\nmirror changes the direction  of light\nthat falls on it. Can you tell in which\ndirection the light falling on a sur face\nwill be reflected? Let us find out.\n13.2 Laws of Reflection\nActivity 13.1\nFix a white sheet of paper on a\ndrawing board or a table. Take acomb and close all its openings\nexcept one in the middle. Y ou can\nuse a strip of black paper for\nthis purpose. Hold the comb\nperpendicular to the sheet of paper .\nThrow light from a torch through\nthe opening of the comb from one\nside (Fig. 13.1). With slight\nadjustment of the torch and the\ncomb you will see a ray of light along\nthe paper on the other side of the\ncomb. Keep the comb and the torch\nsteady. Place a strip of plane mirror\nin the path of the light ray\n(Fig. 13.1). What do you observe?\nAfter striking the mirr or, the ray of\nlight is reflected in another direction.\nThe light ray, which strikes any sur face,\nis called the incident ray . The ray that\ncomes back fr om the sur face after\nreflection is known as the reflected ray .Fig. 13.1 : Arrangement for showing reflection\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 166\nA ray of light is an idealisation.

The\nangle between the normal and the\nreflected ray is known as the \nangle of\nreflection  (\u2220 \u2220\u2220 \u2220\u2220r) (Fig. 13.3). Measure the\nangle of incidence and the angle of\nreflection. Repeat the activity several\ntimes by changing the  angle of\nincidence. Enter the data  in Table 13.1.\n2024-25\n\nLIGHT 167position.

You, too, can use the\nSun as the source of light.\nThese activities can also be performed\nby making use of the Ray Streak\nApparatus (available in the kit\nprepared by NCER T).\nBoojho remembered that in Class VII,\nhe had studied some features of the\nimage of an object formed by a plane\nmirror . Paheli asked him to r ecall\nthose features:\n(i)Was the image er ect or upside\ndown?\n(ii)Was it of the same size as the\nobject?\n(iii)Did the image appear at  the same\ndistance behind the mirror as the\nobject was in front of it?\n(iv)Could it be obtained on a screen?\nLet us understand a little more about\nthe formation of an image by a plane\nmirror in the following way:\nActivity 13.3\nA source of light O is placed in front\nof a plane mirror PQ. Two rays OA\nand OC are incident on it (Fig. 13.5).\nCan you find out the direction of\nthe reflected rays?\nDraw nor mals to the sur face of\nthe mirror PQ, at the points A and\nC. Then draw the reflected rays at\nthe points A and C. How would you\ndraw these rays? Call the reflected\nrays AB and CD, respectively.\nExtend them further . Do they meet?\nExtend them backwards. Do they\nmeet now? If they meet, mark this\npoint as I. For a viewer\u2019s eye at E\n(Fig. 13 .5), do the reflected rays(b)\nFig. 13.4 (a), (b) : Incident ray, reflected ray\nand the normal at the point\nof incidence lie in the same\nplane\nWhen the whole sheet of paper is\nspread on the table, it represents one\nplane. The incident ray, the normal at\nthe point of incidence and the reflected\nray are all in this plane. When you bend\nthe paper you create a plane different\nfrom the plane in which the incident\nray and the normal lie. Then you do not\nsee the reflected ray. What does it\nindicate? It indicates that the incident\nray, the normal at the point of\nincidence and the reflected ray all lie\nin the same plane. This is another law\nof reflection.\nPaheli and Booj ho per formed the\nabove activities outside the classroom\n(a)\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 168appear to come from the point I.\nSince the reflected rays do not\nactually meet at I, but only appear\nto do so, we say that a virtual image\nof the point O is formed at I. As you\nhave learnt already in Class VII,\nsuch an image cannot be obtained\non a screen.\nYou may recall that in an image\nformed by a  mirror the left of the object\nappears on the right and the right\nappears on the left. This is known as\nlateral inversion .\n13.3 Regular and Diffused\nReflection\nActivity 13.4\nImagine that parallel rays are\nincident on an irr egular sur face as\nshown in Fig. 13.6. Remember that\nthe laws of reflection are valid at\neach point of the sur face. Use these\nlaws to construct reflected rays at\nvarious points. Are they parallel to\none another? Y ou will find that\nthese rays are reflected in different\ndirections. (Fig. 13.7)When all the parallel rays reflected\nfrom a r ough or irr egular sur face ar e\nnot parallel, the reflection is known as\ndiffused  or irregular  reflection.\nRemember that the diffused reflection\nis not due to the failure of the laws of\nreflection. It is caused by the\nirregularities in the reflecting sur face,\nlike that of a cardboard.\nOn the other hand , reflection from\na smooth sur face like that of a\nmirror is called regular reflection\n(Fig. 1 3.8). Images are formed by\nregular reflection.Fig. 13.5 : Image formation in a plane mirrorFig. 13.6 : Parallel rays incident on\nan irregular surface\nFig. 13.7 : Rays reflected from irregular\nsurface\nFig. 13.8 : Regular reflection\n2024-25\n\nLIGHT 169Let us find out.\n13.4 Reflected Light Can be\nReflected Again\nRecall the last time you visited a hair\ndresser . She/he makes you sit in front of\na mirr or. After your hair cut is complete,\nshe/he holds  a mirror behind you  to show\nyou how the hair has been cut\n(Fig. 1 3.9). \nDo you know how you could\nsee the hair at the back of your head?Paheli recalls having constructed a\nperiscope as an Extended Activity in\nClass VI. The periscope makes use of\ntwo plane mirrors. Can you explain\nhow reflection from the two mirrors\nenables you to see objects which are\nnot visible directly? Periscopes are\nused in submarines, tanks and also\nby soldiers in bunkers to see things\noutside.\n13.5 Multiple Images\nYou ar e awar e that a plane mirr or for ms\nonly a single image of an object. What\nhappens if two plane mirrors are used\nin combination? Let us see.Do W e See all Objects due to Reflected Light?\nNearly everything you see around is seen due to reflected light. Moon, for example,\nreceives light from the Sun and reflects it. That\u2019s how we see the moon. The objects\nwhich shine in the light of other objects are called illuminated  objects . Can you\nname some other such objects?\nThere are other objects, which give their own light, such as the Sun, fire, flame\nof a candle and an electric lamp. Their  light falls on our eyes. That is how we see\nthem. The objects which emit their own light are known as luminous objects.\nFig. 13.9 : Mirror at the hair dresser shop\nI have a question. Can the\nreflected rays be further reflected\nif incident on another mirror?\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 170Activity 13.5\nTake two plane mirrors. Set them\nat right angles to each other with\ntheir edges touching (Fig. 13.10). To\nhinge them you can use adhesive\ntape. Place a coin in between the\nmirrors. How many images of the\ncoin do you see (Fig. 13.10)?\nNow hinge the mirrors using the\nadhesive tape at different angles, say\n45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 180\u00b0 etc. Place some\nobject (say a candle) in between\nthem. Note down the number of\nimages of the object in each case.\nFinally, set the two mirrors\nparallel to each other . Find out\nhow many images of a candle\nplaced between them are formed\n(Fig. 13.11).Fig. 13.10 : Images in plane mirror at right\nangle to each other\nFig. 13.11 : Image in plane mirror parallel\nto each other\nmirrors\n(a)\n(b) (c)Can you now explain how you can\nsee the back of your head at the hair\ndresser\u2019s shop?\nThis idea of number of images formed\nby mirrors placed at an angle to one\nanother is used in a kaleidoscope to\nmake numer ous beautiful patter ns. You\ncan also make a kaleidoscope yourself.\nKaleidoscope\nActivity 13.6\nTo make a kaleidoscope, get three\nrectangular mirror strips each about\n15 cm long and 4 cm wide. Join\nthem together to form a prism as\nshown in Fig. 13.12(a). Fix this\narrangement of mirrors in a circular\ncardboard tube or tube of a thick\nchart paper . Make sur e that the tube\nis slightly longer than the mirror\nstrips. Close one end of the tube by\na cardboard disc having a hole in\nthe centre, through which you can\nsee [Fig. 13.12(b)]. To make the disc\ndurable, paste a piece of transparent\nplastic sheet under the cardboard\nFig. 13.12 : Making a kaleidoscope\n2024-25\n\nLIGHT 171disc. At the other end, touching the\nmirrors, fix a circular plane glass\nplate [Fig. 13.12(c)]. Place on this\nglass plate several small pieces of\ncoloured glass (broken pieces of\ncoloured bangles). Close this end of\nthe tube by a ground glass plate.\nAllow enough space for the colour\npieces to move around.\nYour kaleidoscope is r eady. When\nyou peep through the hole, you will be\nable to see a variety of patterns in the\ntube. An interesting feature of a\nkaleidoscope is that you will never see\nthe same pattern again. Designers of\nwallpapers and fabrics and artists often\nuse kaleidoscopes to get ideas for new\npatterns. To make your toy attractive,\nyou can wrap the kaleidoscope in a\ncolour ed paper .13.6 Sunlight \u2014 White or\nColoured\nIn Class VII, you learnt that the sunlight\nis referred to as white light. Y ou also\nlearnt that it consists of seven colours.\nHere is another activity (Activity 13.7)\nshowing that sunlight consists of several\ncolours.\n13.7 What is inside Our Eyes?\nWe see things only when light coming\nfrom them enters our eyes. Eye is one\nof our most important sense organs. It\nis, therefore, important to understand\nits structure and working.\nThe eye has a roughly spherical\nshape. The outer coat of the eye is\nwhite. It is tough so that it can protect\nthe interior of the eye from accidents.\nIts transparent front part is called\nActivity 13.7\nFig. 13.13 : Dispersion of lightGet a plane mirror of a suitable size.\nPlace it in a bowl ( katori) as shown\nin Fig. 1 3.13. Fill the bowl with\nwater . Put this arrangement near a\nwindow in such a way that direct\nsunlight falls on the mirr or. Adjust\nthe position of the\nbowl so that the\nreflected light from\nthe mirror falls on\na wall. If the wall is\nnot white, fix a sheet\nof white paper on it.\nReflected light will\nbe seen to have\nmany colours. How\ncan you explain\nthis? The mirror\nand water form aprism. As you learnt in Class VII ,\nthis breaks up the light into its\ncolours,  Splitting of light into its\ncolours is known as dispersion  of\nlight.  Rainbow is a natural\nphenomenon showing dispersion.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 172Fig. 13.15 : Demonstration of blind spotCaution : For this activity, never use\na laser torch.\nActivity 13.8\nLook into your friend\u2019s eye. Observe\nthe size of the pupil. Throw light on\nher eye with a torch. Observe the\npupil now. Switch off the torch, and\nobserve her pupil once again. Do\nyou notice any change in the size\nof the pupil? In which case was the\npupil larger? Why do you think it\nwas so?\nIn which case do you need to\nallow more light in the eye, when\nthe light is dim or bright?\nBehind the pupil of the eye is a lens\nwhich is thicker in the centre. What\nkind of lens is thicker at the centre?\nRecall what you learnt about lenses incornea  (Fig. 13.14).  Behind the cornea,\nwe find a dark muscular structure\ncalled iris. In the iris, there is a small\nopening called the pupil. The size of\nthe pupil is controlled by the iris. The\niris is that part of eye which gives it its\ndistinctive colour . When we say that a\nperson has green eyes, we refer actually\nto the colour of the iris. The iris controls\nthe amount of light entering into the\neye. Let us see how.\nIris\nLens\nCiliary\nmuscle\nCornea\nRetinaOptic\nNerve\nFig. 13.14 : Human eyeClass VII. The lens focuses light on the\nback of the eye, on a layer  called retina\n(Fig. 13.14). The retina contains several\nnerve cells. Sensations felt by the nerve\ncells are then transmitted to the brain\nthrough the optic nerve. There are two\nkinds of cells\u2013\n(i)cones, which are sensitive to bright\nlight and\n(ii)rods, which are sensitive to dim light.\nCones sense colour . At the junction\nof the optic nerve and the retina, there\nare no sensory cells, so no vision is\npossible at that spot. This is called the\nblind spot . Its existence can be\ndemonstrated as follows:\nActivity 13.9\nMake a round mark and a cross on\na sheet of paper with the spot to the\nright of the cross (Fig. 13.15). The\ndistance between two marks may be\n6-8 cm. Hold the sheet of paper at\nan arm\u2019s length from the eye. Close\nyour left eye. Look continuously at\nthe cross. Move the sheet slowly\ntowards you, keeping your eye on\nthe cross. What do you find? Does\nthe round mark disappear at some\npoint? Now close your right eye.\nLook at the round mark now and\nrepeat the activity. Does the cross\ndisappear? The disappearance of the\ncross or the round mark shows that\nthere is a point on the retina which\ncannot send messages to the brain\nwhen light falls on it.\n2024-25\n\nLIGHT 173Nature has provided eyes with\neyelids to prevent any object from\nentering the eye. Eyelids also shut out\nlight when not required.\nEye is such a wonder ful instrument\nthat it (normal) can clearly\n see distant\nobjects as well as objects nearby . The\nminimum distance at which the eye can\nsee objects distinctly varies with age. The\nmost comfortable distance at which one\ncan read with a normal eye is about\n25 cm.\nSome persons can see objects close\nto them clearly but cannot see distant\nobjects so clearly. On the other hand,\nsome persons cannot see objects nearby\nclearly but they can see distant objects\nquite well. With suitable corrective\nlenses, these defects of the eye can\nbe corrected.\nSometimes, particularly in old age,\neyesight becomes foggy. It is due to the\neye lens becoming cloudy. When it\nhappens, persons are said to have\ncataract. There is a loss of vision,\nsometimes extremely severe. It is\npossible to treat this defect. The opaque\nlens is removed and a new artificial\nlens is inserted. Modern technology\nhas made this procedure simpler\nand safer .\n13.8 Care of the Eyes\nIt is necessary that you take proper care\nof your eyes. If there is any problem\nyou should go to an eye specialist. Have\na regular checkup\u2014\nlIf advised, use suitable spectacles.\nlToo little or too much light is bad\nfor eyes. Insufficient light causes\neyestrain and headaches. Too much\nlight, like that of the Sun, a power fulThe movies that we see are actually\na number of separate pictures in\nproper sequence. They are made to\nmove across the eye usually at the rate\nof 24 pictures  per second (faster\nthan 16 per second). So, we see a\nmoving picture.\nFront side of\ncardboardReverse side\nof cardboardThe impression of an image does not\nvanish immediately from the retina. It\npersists there for about 1/16th of a\nsecond. So, if still images of a moving\nobject are flashed on the eye at a rate\nfaster than 16 per second, then the eye\nperceives this object as moving.\nActivity 13.10\nGet a square piece of cardboard of\nsize 6-8 cm. Make two holes as\nshown in Fig. 13.16. Thread a\nstring through the two holes. Draw/\npaste a cage on one side of the\ncardboard and a bird on the other\nside. Twist the string and make the\ncard twirl rapidly. Do you see the\nbird in the cage?\nFig. 13.16 : Bird in cage\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 174lamp or a laser torch can injure the\nretina.\nlDo not look at the Sun or a power ful\nlight directly.\nlNever rub your eyes. If particles of\ndust go into your eyes, wash your\neyes with clean water . If there is no\nimprovement go to a doctor .\nlAlways read at the normal distance\nfor vision. Do not read by bringing\nthe book too close to your eyes or\nkeeping it too far .\nYou lear nt about balanced diet in\nClass VI. If food is deficient in some\ncomponents, eyes may also suf fer. Lack\nof vitamin A in foodstuff is responsible\nfor many eye troubles.  Most common\namongst them is night blindness.\nOne should, therefore, include in the\ndiet components which have vitamin A.\nRaw carrots, broccoli and greenDid you know?\nAnimals have eyes shaped in different ways. Eyes of a crab are quite small but\nthey enable the crab to look all around. So, the crab can sense even if the enemy\napproaches from behind. Butterflies have large eyes that seem to be made up\nof thousands of little eyes\n(Fig. 13.17). They can see not only\nin the front and the sides but the\nback as well.\nA night bird (owl) can see very\nwell in the night but not during\nthe day. On the other hand, day\nlight birds (kite, eagle) can see\nwell during the day but not in the\nnight. The owl has a large cornea\nand a large pupil to allow more\nlight in its eye. Also, it has on its\nretina a large number of rods and\nonly a few cones. The day birds\non the other hand, have more\ncones and fewer rods.Fig. 13.17 : Eyes of a butterfly\nEyes\nvegetables (such as spinach) and cod\nliver oil are rich in vitamin A. Eggs,\nmilk, curd, cheese, butter and fruits\nsuch as papaya and mango are also rich\nin vitamin A.\n13.9 Visually Impaired\nPersons Can Read and\nWrite\nSome persons, including children, can\nbe visually impaired. They have very\nlimited vision to see things. Some\npersons cannot see at all since birth.\nSome persons may lose their eyesight\nbecause of a disease or an injury. Such\npersons try to identify things by\ntouching and listening to voices more\ncarefully. They develop their other\nsenses mor e sharply. However ,\nadditional resources can enable them\nto develop their capabilities further .\n2024-25\n\nLIGHT 17513.10 What is the Braille\nSystem?\nThe most popular resource for visually\nchallenged persons is Braille .\nLouis Braille\nLouis Braille, himself a visually\nchallenged person, developed a\nsystem for visually challenged persons\nand published it in 1821.Non-optical and optical aids for visually impaired\nNon-optical aids include visual aids, tactual aids (using the sense of touch), auditory\naids (using the sense of hearing) and electronic aids. Visual aids, can magnify\nwords, can provide suitable intensity of light and material at proper distances.\nTactual aids, including Braille writer slate and stylus, help the visually challenged\npersons in taking notes, reading and writing. Auditory aids include cassettes, tape\nrecorders, talking books and other such devices. Electronic aids, such as talking\ncalculators  and computers , are also available for performing many computational\ntasks. Closed circuit television, also an electronic aid, enlarges printed material\nwith suitable contrast and illumination. Nowadays, use of audio CDs and voice boxes\nwith computers are also very helpful for listening to and writing the desired text.\nOptical aids include bifocal lenses, contact lenses, tinted lenses, magnifiers\nand telescopic aids. While the lens combinations are used to rectify visual\nlimitations, telescopic aids are available to view chalkboard and class\ndemonstrations.\nThe present system was adopted in\n1932. There is Braille code for common\nlanguages, mathematics and scientific\nnotation. Many Indian languages can\nbe read using the Braille system.Braille system has 63 dot patterns or\ncharacters. Each character\nrepresents a letter , a combination of\nletters, a common word or a\ngrammatical sign. Dots are arranged\nin cells of two vertical rows of three\ndots each.\nPatterns of dots to represent some\nEnglish letters and some common\nwords are shown below.\nThese patterns when embossed on\nBraille sheets help visually\nchallenged persons to recognise words\nby touching. To make them easier to\ntouch, the dots are raised slightly.Fig. 13.18 : Example of dot patterns used\nin Braille System\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 176\nSome visually impaired Indians have great achievements to their\ncredit. Diwakar , a child pr odigy has given amazing per formances\nas a singer .\nRavindra Jain, born completely visually impaired, obtained\nhis Sangeet Prabhakar degree from Allahabad. He had shown his\nexcellence as a lyricist, singer and music composer .\nLal Advani, himself visually impaired, established an\nAssociation for special education and rehabilitation of disabled\nin India. Besides this, he represented India on Braille problems\nin UNESCO.\nHelen A. Keller , an American author and lectur er, is per haps the most well-\nknown and inspiring visually challenged person. She lost her sight when she was\nonly 18 months old. But because of her resolve and courage she could complete\nher graduation from a university. She wrote a number of books including The\nStory of my Life  (1903).Helen A. KellerVisually impaired people learn the\nBraille system by beginning with\nletters,  then special characters and\nletter combinations. Methods depend\nupon recognition by touching. Eachcharacter has to be memorised. Braille\ntexts can be produced by hand or by\nmachine.

Mor eover , ther e will be\nincreased chances of natural calamities\nsuch as floods and droughts.\nRecall that plants need carbon\ndioxide for photosynthesis. Fewer trees\nwould mean that less carbon dioxide will\nbe used up resulting in its increasedWhat is the purpose of\nmaking national parks,\nwildlife sanctuaries and\nbiosphere reserves?\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 54amount in the atmosphere. This will lead\nto global warming as carbon dioxide\ntraps the heat rays reflected by the earth.\nThe increase in temperature on the earth\ndisturbs the water cycle and may reduce\nrainfall. This could cause droughts .\nDeforestation is a major cause which\nleads to the change in soil properties.\nPhysical properties of the soil get affected\nby plantation and vegetation. Fewer\ntrees result in more soil erosion.\nRemoval of the top layer of the soil\nexposes the lower , har d and r ocky\nlayers. This soil has less humus and is\nless fertile. Gradually the fertile land\ngets converted into deserts. It is called\ndesertification .\nDeforestation also leads to a decrease\nin the water holding capacity of the soil.\nThe movement of water from the soil\nsurface into the gr ound (infiltration rate)\nis reduced. So, there are floods. The\nother properties of the soil like nutrient\ncontent, texture etc., also change\nbecause of deforestation.\nWe have studied in Class VII that we\nget many products from forests. List these\nproducts. Will we face shortage of these\nproducts if we continue cutting trees?\nActivity 5.2\nAnimal life is also affected by\ndeforestation. How? List the points\nand discuss them in your class.\n5.3 Conservation of Forest\nand Wildlife\nHaving become aware of the effects of\ndeforestation, Paheli and Boojho are\nworried. They go to Professor Ahmad\nand ask him how forests and wildlife\ncan be saved.Biosphere is that part of the earth in\nwhich living organisms exist or which\nsupports life. Biological diversity or\nbiodiversity, refers  to the variety of\norganisms existing on the earth, their\ninterrelationships and their\nrelationship with the environment.\nProfessor  Ahmad organi ses a visit to\na biosphere reserve for Paheli, Boojho and\ntheir classmates. He selects a place\nnamed Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve. He\nknows that the plants and animals found\nhere are similar to those of the upper\nHimalayan peaks and to those belonging\nto the lower western ghats. Professor\nAhmad believes that the biodiversity\nfound here is unique. He requests\nMadhavji, a forest employee, to guide the\nchildren inside the biosphere reserve. He\nexplains that preserving areas of such\nbiological importance make them a part\nof our national heritage .\nMadhavji explains to the children\nthat apart from our personal efforts and\nefforts of the society, government\nTo protect our flora and fauna and their\nhabitats, protected areas  called\nwildlife sanctuaries, national parks\nand biosphere reserves have been\nearmarked. Plantation, cultivation,\ngrazing, felling trees, hunting and\npoaching are prohibited there.\nWildlife Sanctuary :  Areas where\nanimals are protected from any\ndisturbance to them and their habitat .\nNational Park : Areas reserved for\nwild life where they can freely use the\nhabitats and natural resources.\nBiosphere Reserve : Large areas of\nprotected land for conservation of wild\nlife, plant and animal resources and\ntraditional life of the tribals living in\nthe area.\n2024-25\n\nCONSER VATION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS 55agencies also take care of the forests and\nanimals. The government lays down\nrules, methods and policies to protect\nand conserve them. Wildlife sanctuaries,\nnational parks, biosphere reserves etc.,\nare protected areas for conservation\nof plants and animals present in\nthat area.\nActivity 5.3\nFind out the number of national\nparks, wildlife sanctuaries and\nbiosphere reserves in your district,\nstate and country. Record in  Table\n5.1. Show these areas in an outline\nmap of your state and India.\nFig. 5.1 :  Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve5.4Biosphere Reserve\nChildren along with Professor Ahmad\nand Madhavji enter the biosphere\nreserve area. Madhavji explains that\nbiosphere reserves  are the areas meant\nfor conservation of biodiversity. As you\nare aware that biodiversity is the variety\nof plants, animals and microorganisms\ngenerally found in an area.  The\nbiosphere reserves  help to maintain the\nbiodiversity and culture of that area. A\nbiosphere reserve may also contain\nother protected areas in it. The\nPachmarhi Biosphere Reserve consists\nof one national park named Satpura and\ntwo wildlife sanctuaries named Bori and\nPachmarhi (Fig. 5.1).\nPACHMARHI SANCTUARY\nTO PIP ARIYATAW\nA\nRESERVIOR\nCHURNA\nBORI SANCTUARYDHAINBORISATPURA NA TIONAL PARKNEEMGHANPANARP ANI GA TE\nPACHMARHI\u2191N\nTable 5.1 : Protected Areas for Conservation\nProtected Areas \u2014 National Park Wildlife Sanctuary Biosphere Reserve\nIn my district\nIn my state\nIn my country\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 56\n(d)             (e) (f)\nFig. \u00a05.2  : (a) W ild dog (b) Cheetal (c) Wolf (d) Leopar d (e) Fern (f) Jamun tr eeActivity  5.4\nList the factors disturbing the\nbiodiversity of your area. Some of\nthese factors and human activities\nmay disturb the biodiversity\nunknowingly. List these human\nactivities. How can these be checked?\nDiscuss in your class and write a\nbrief report in your notebook.\n5.5  Flora and Fauna\nAs the children walk around the\nbiosphere reserve they appreciate thegreen wealth of the forest. They are\nvery happy to see tall teak trees and\nanimals inside the forest. Suddenly,\nPaheli finds a rabbit and wants to\ncatch it. She starts running after it.\nProfessor Ahmad stops her . He\nexplains that animals are comfortable\nand happy in their own habitat. W e\nshould not disturb them. Madhavji\nexplains that some animals and plants\ntypically belong to a particular area.\nThe plants and animals found in a\nparticular area are termed flora  and\nfauna  respectively  of that area.\nSal, teak, mango, jamun , silver ferns, arjun,  etc., are the flora and chinkara , blue-\nbull, barking deer , cheetal , leopar d, wild dog, wolf, etc. ar e examples of the fauna\nof the Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve (Fig. 5.2).\n(a) (b) (c)\n2024-25\n\nCONSER VATION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS 57\nI have heard that some of the\nendemic species may vanish.\nIs it true?Activity 5.5\nTry to identify the flora and fauna\nof your area and list them.\n5.6Endemic Species\nSoon the group quietly enters the deep\nforest. Children are surprised to see a\nvery big squirrel. This squirrel has a big\nfluffy tail. They are very curious to know\nabout it. Madhavji tells them that this\nis known as the giant squirrel and is\nendemic to this area.\nEndemic species  are those species\nof plants and animals which are found\nexclusively in a particular area. They are\nnot naturally found  anywhere else. A\nparticular type of animal or plant may\nbe endemic to a zone, a state or a country.\nMadhavji shows sal  and wild mango\n(Fig. 5.3 (a)] as two examples of the\nFig. 5.3 (a) : Wild Mango\nFig. 5.3 (b) :  Giant squirrelendemic flora of the Pachmarhi\nBiosphere Reserve. Bison, Indian giant\nsquirrel [Fig. 5.3 (b)] and flying squirrel\nare endemic fauna of this area. Professor\nAhmad explains that the destruction of\ntheir habitat,  increasing population and\nintroduction of new species may affect\nthe natural habitat of endemic species\nand endanger their existence.\nSpecies  is a group of population\nwhich are capable of interbreeding.\nThis means that the members of a\nspecies can reproduce fertile offspring\nonly with the members of their own\nspecies and not with members of\nother species. Members of a species\nhave common characteristics.\nActivity 5.6\nFind out the endemic plants and\nanimals of the region where you live.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 585.7 Wildlife Sanctuary\nSoon Paheli sees a board with \u2018Pachmarhi\nWildlife Sanctuary\u2019 written on it.\nProfessor Ahmad explains that killing\n(poaching) or capturing animals in general\nis strictly prohibited and punishable\nby law in all such places. Wildlife\nSanctuaries  like reserve forests provide\nprotection and suitable living conditions\nto wild animals. He also tells them that\npeople living in wildlife sanctuaries are\nallowed to do certain activities such as\ngrazing by their livestock, collecting\nmedicinal plants, firewood, etc.instead of  their natural habitat? In\nyour opinion, will the animals be\ncomfortable in a zoo or in their\nnatural habitat?\n5.8  National Park\nOn the roadside there was another\nboard on which was written \u2018Satpura\nNational Park\u2019.\nChildren are now eager to go there.\nMadhavji tells them that these reserves\nare large and diverse enough to protect\nwhole sets of ecosystems. They preserve\nflora, fauna, landscape and historic\nobjects of an area. Satpura National\nPark is the first Reserve Forest of India.\nThe finest Indian teak is found in this\nforest.  There are more than one hundred\nNational Parks i n India.\n It is a pity that even protected forests\nare not safe because people living in the\nneighbourhood encroach upon them\nand destroy them.\nChildren are reminded of their visit\nto the zoo. They recall that zoos are also\nplaces where animals receive protection.Some of the threatened wild animals\nlike black buck, white eyed buck,\nelephant, golden cat, pink headed\nduck, gharial, marsh crocodile,\npython, rhinoceros, etc., are\nprotected and preserved in our wild\nlife sanctuaries. Indian sanctuaries\nhave unique landscapes\u2014broad level\nforests, mountain forests and bush\nlands in deltas of big rivers.\nActivity 5.7\nVisit a nearby zoo. Observe the\nconditions provided to the animals.\nWere they suitable for the animals?\nCan animals live in artificial settingRock shelters are also found inside\nthe Satpura National Park. These are\nevidences of prehistoric human life\nin these jungles. These give us an\nidea of the life of primitive people.\nRock paintings are found in these\nshelters. A total of 55 rock shelters\nhave been identified in Pachmarhi\nBiosphere Reserve.\nFigures of animals and men\nfighting, hunting, dancing and\nplaying musical instruments are\ndepicted in these paintings. Many\ntribals still live in the area.\nAs children move ahead, they see a\nboar d with \u2018Satpura T iger Reserve\u2019\nwritten on it. Madhavji explains that\nProject Tiger  was launched by the\ngovernment to protect the tigers in the\ncountry. The objective of this project\nwas to ensure the survival and\nmaintenance of the tiger population in\nthe country.What is the difference between\na zoo and a wildlife sanctuary?\n2024-25\n\nCONSER VATION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS 59Are tigers still found in this\nforest? I hope I can see a tiger!\nTiger (Fig. 5.4) is one of the many\nspecies which are slowly disappearing\nfrom our for ests. But, the Satpura T iger\nReserve is unique in the sense that a\nsignificant increase in the population of\ntigers has been seen here. Once upon a\ntime, animals like lions, elephants, wild\nanimals has become difficult because of\ndisturbances in their natural habitat.\nProfessor Ahmad tells them that in order\nto protect plants and animals strict rules\nare imposed in all National Parks.\nHuman activities such as grazing,\npoaching, hunting, capturing of animals\nFig. 5.4 :  Tiger\nbuffaloes (Fig. 5 .5) and barasingha\n(Fig. 5.6) were also found in the Satpura\nNational Park. Animals whose numbers\nare diminishing to a level that they might\nface extinction are known as the\nendangered animals . Boojho is\nreminded of the dinosaurs which became\nextinct a long time ago. Survival of some\nFig. 5.5 :  Wild buffaloFig. 5.6 :  Barasingha\nAre only big animals\nfacing extinction?\nMadhavji tells Paheli that small\nanimals are much more in danger of\nbecoming extinct than the bigger\nanimals. At times, we kill snakes, frogs,\nlizards, bats and owls ruthlessly without\nrealising their importance in the\necosystem. By killing them we are\nharming ourselves. They might be small\nin size but their role in the ecosystem\ncannot be ignored. They form part of\nfood chains and food webs.\nAn ecosystem  is made of all the\nplants, animals and microorganisms in\nan area along with non-living\ncomponents such as climate, soil,\nriver deltas etc.or collection of firewood,\nmdicinal plants, etc. are\nnot allowed\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 605.9Red Data Book\nProfessor  Ahmad explains about Red\nData Book to the children. He tells\nthem that Red Data Book  is the\nsource book which keeps a record of\nall the endangered animals and\nplants. Red  Data Book is maintained\ninternationally by an organisation .\nIndia also maintains Red Data Book\nfor plants and animal s found\nin India.\n5.10  Migration\nThe excursion party then enters deeper\ninto the forest under the guidance of\nMadhavji. They sit near the Tawa\nWhat would happen if we\nhad no wood? Is there\nany alternative\navailable to wood?\nI know that paper is one\nof the important products\nwe get from forests.\nI wonder whether\nthere are any alternatives\navailable for paper!Is there any permanent\nsolution to the problem\nof deforestation?Reservoir to relax for some time. Paheli\nobserves some of the birds near the\nriver. Madhavji tells the childr en that\nthese are migratory birds. These birds\nhave flown here from other parts of\nthe world.\nMigratory birds fly to far away areas\nevery year during a particular time\nbecause of climatic changes. They fly\nfor laying eggs as the weather in their\nnatural habitat becomes very cold and\ninhospitable. Birds who cover long\ndistances to reach another land are\nknown as migratory birds.\n5.11  Recycling of Paper\nProfessor  Ahmad draws attention of\nthe children to another cause of\ndeforestation. He tells them that it\ntakes 17 full grown trees to make one\ntonne of paper . Ther efore, we should\nsave paper . Professor  Ahmad also tells\nthat paper can be recycled five to seven\ntimes for use. If each student saves at\nleast one sheet of paper in a day, we\ncan save many tr ees in a year . We\nshould save, reuse used paper and\nrecycle it. By this we not only save\ntrees but also save  energy and water\nneeded for manufacturing paper .\nMoreover , the amount of har mful\nchemicals used in paper making will\nalso be reduced.I wonder if there is\nany record of all\nendangered species!\n2024-25\n\nCONSER VATION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS 615.12  Reforestation\nProfessor Ahmad suggests that the\nanswer to deforestation is reforestation.\nReforestation is restocking of the\ndestroyed forests by planting new trees.\nThe planted trees should generally be\nof the same species which were found\nin that for est. W e should plant at least\nas many trees as we cut. Reforestation\ncan take place naturally also. If the\ndeforested area is left undisturbed, it re-\nestablishes itself. In natural reforestation\nthere is no r ole of human beings. W e\nhave already caused tremendous\ndamage to our forests. If we have toretain our green wealth for future\ngenerations, plantation of more trees is\nthe only option.\nProfessor Ahmad told them that in\nIndia we have the Forest (Conservation)\nAct. This act is aimed at preservation\nand conservation of natural forests and\nmeeting the basic needs of the people\nliving in or near the forests.\nAfter some rest Madhavji asks the\nchildren to start heading back because\nit is not advisable to stay in the\njungle after sunset. On getting back,\nProfessor Ahmad and the children\nthank Madhavji for guiding them\nthrough this exciting experience.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 62\n WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\n\u00dcWildlife sanctuary, national park and bio-\nsphere reserve are names given to the areas\nmeant for conservation and preservation of\nforest and wild animals.\n\u00dcBiodiversity refers to the variety of living\norganisms in a specific area.\n\u00dcPlants and animals of a particular area are\nknown as the flora and  fauna of  that area.\n\u00dcEndemic species are found only in a particular\narea.\n\u00dcEndangered species are those which are facing\nthe danger of extinction.\n\u00dcRed Data Book contains a record of\nendangered species.\n\u00dcMigration is the phenomenon of movement of\na species from its own habitat to some other\nhabitat for a particular time period every year\nfor a specific purpose like breeding.\n\u00dcWe should save, r euse and r ecycle paper to\nsave trees, ener gy and water .\n\u00dcReforestation is the restocking of destroyed\nforests by planting new trees.\nExercises\n  1.Fill in the blanks.\n(a)A place where animals are protected in their natural habitat is\ncalled .\n(b)Species found only in a particular area is known as .\n(c)Migratory birds fly to far away places because of  changes.\n  2.Differentiate between the following.\n(a)Wildlife sanctuary and biosphere reserve\n(b)Zoo and wildlife sanctuary\n(c)Endangered and extinct species\n(d)Flora and fauna KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS\nBIODIVERSITY\nBIOSPHERE RESERVE\nDEFOREST ATION\nDESER TIFICA TION\nECOSYSTEM\nENDANGERED\nSPECIES\nENDEMIC SPECIES\nEXTINCT\nFAUNA\nFLORA\nMIGRA TORY BIRDS\nNATIONAL PARK\nRED DA TA BOOK\nREFOREST ATION\nSANCTUARY\n2024-25\n\nCONSER VATION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS 63  3.Discuss the effects of deforestation on the following.\n(a)Wild animals\n(b)Environment\n(c)Villages (Rural areas)\n(d)Cities (Urban areas)\n(e)Earth\n(f)The next generation\n  4.What will happen if.\n(a)we go on cutting trees.\n(b)the habitat of an animal is disturbed.\n(c)the top layer of soil is exposed.\n  5.Answer in brief.\n(a)Why should we conserve biodiversity?\n(b)Protected forests are also not completely safe for wild animals.

These\nprocesses are essential for the survival\nof every individual. Y ou have also lear nt\nabout the process of reproduction in\nplants. Reproduction is essential for the\ncontinuation of a species. Imagine what\nwould have happened if organisms had\nnot r eproduced. Y ou will r ealise that\nreproduction is very important as it\nensures the continuation of similar\nkinds of individuals, generation after\ngeneration.\nYou have alr eady lear nt in your\nprevious class about reproduction in\nplants. In this chapter , we shall lear n\nhow reproduction takes place in\nanimals.\n6.1 Modes of Reproduction\nHave you seen the young ones\nof dif ferent animals? T ry to name some\nof the young ones by completing\nTable 6.1 shown in examples at S. No.\n1 and 5.\nYou must have seen the young\nones of various animals being born.\nCan you tell how chicks and\ncaterpillars are born? How are kittens\nand puppies born? Do you think that\nthese young ones looked the same\nbefore they were born as they do now?\nLet us find out.Just as in plants, there are two modes\nby which animals reproduce. These are:\n(i)Sexual reproduction, and\n(ii)Asexual reproduction.\n6.2 Sexual Reproduction\nTry to r ecall r eproduction in plants\nwhich you studied in Class VII. Y ou will\nremember that plants that reproduce\nsexually have male and female\nreproductive parts. Can you name these\nparts? In animals also, males and\nfemales have different reproductive parts\nor organs. Like plants, the reproductive\nparts in animals also produce gametes\nthat fuse to form a zygote. It is the zygote\nwhich develops into a new individual.\nThis type of reproduction beginning\nfrom the fusion of male and female\ngametes is called sexual reproduction .\nLet us find out the reproductive partsTable 6.1\nS. No. Animal Young one\n1. Human Baby\n2. Cat\n3. Dog\n4. Butterfly\n5. Hen Chick\n6. Cow\n7. Frog\n2024-25\n\nin humans and study the process of\nreproduction in them.\nMale Reproductive Organs\nThe male reproductive organs include a\npair of testes (singular , testis), two sper m\nducts and a penis (Fig. 6.1). The testes\nproduce the male gametes called\nsperms . Millions of sperms are produced\nby the testes. Look at Fig. 6.2 which\nshows the picture of a sperm. Though\nsperms are very small in size, each has\na head, a middle piece and a tail. Does\nit appear to be a single cell? Indeed, eachsperm is a single cell with all the usual\ncell components.\nFig. 6.1: Male reproductive\norgans in humansWhat purpose does the\ntail in a sperm serve?\nFig. 6.3 : Female reproductive organs in\nhumansFemale Reproductive Organs\nThe female reproductive organs are a pair\nof ovaries, oviducts (fallopian tubes) and\nthe uterus (Fig. 6.3). The ovary produces\nOviduct\nOvary\nUterus\nHead\nMiddle piece\nTail\nFig. 6.2 :  Human sperm\nREPRODUCTION  IN ANIMALS 67\nSperm\nduct\nTestisPenis\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 68Boojho recalls that the size\nof eggs in animals varies.\nThe egg may be very small\nas in humans, much larger\nas in hens. Ostrich egg is\nthe largest!\nFertilisation\nThe first step in the process of\nreproduction is the fusion of a sperm\nand an ovum. When sperms come in\ncontact with an egg, one of the sperms\nmay fuse with the egg. Such fusion of\nthe egg and the sperm is called\nfertilisation (Fig. 6.5). During\nfertilisation, the nuclei of the sperm and\nthe egg fuse to form a single nucleus.\nThis results in the formation of a\nfertilised egg or zygote (Fig. 6.6). Did\nFig. 6.5 :  Fertilisation\nFig. 6.4 :  Human OvumNucleusSperms\nOvum\nFusing\nnuclei\nThe process of fertilisation is the\nmeeting of an egg cell from the mother\nand a sper m cell fr om the father . So,\nthe new individual inherits some\ncharacteristics  from the mother and\nsome fr om the father . Look at your\nbrother or sister . See if you can r ecognise\nsome characters in them similar to those\nof your mother or your father .\nFertilisation which takes place inside\nthe female body is called internal\nfertilisation . Internal fertilisation\noccurs in many animals including\nhumans, cows, dogs and hens.Fig. 6.6 :  Zygotefemale gametes called ova (eggs)\n(Fig. 6.4). In human beings, a single\nmatured egg is released into the oviduct\nby one of the ovaries every month.\nUterus is the part where development of\nthe baby takes place. Like the sperm,\nan egg is also a single cell.\nyou know that the zygote is the\nbeginning of a new individual?\n2024-25\n\nREPRODUCTION  IN ANIMALS 69Why do fish and\nfrogs lay eggs in\nhundreds whereas a\nhen lays only one\negg at a time?\nHave you heard of\ntest tube babies?\nBoojho and Paheli\u2019s teacher once told\nthem in the class that in some women\noviducts are blocked. These women\nare unable to bear babies because\nsperms cannot reach the egg for\nfertilisation. In such cases, doctors\ncollect freshly released egg and\nsperms and keep them together for a\nfew hours for IVF or in vitro\nfertilisation  (fertilisation outside the\nbody). In case fertilisation occurs,\nthe zygote is allowed to develop for\nabout a week and then it is placed in\nthe mother\u2019s uterus. Complete\ndevelopment takes place in the uterus\nand the baby is born like any other\nbaby. Babies born through this\ntechnique are called test-tube\nbabies . This term is actually\nmisleading because babies cannot\ngrow in test tubes.female lays hundreds of eggs. Unlike\nhen\u2019s egg, frog\u2019s egg is not covered by a\nshell and it is comparatively very\ndelicate. A layer of jelly holds the eggs\ntogether and provides protection to the\neggs (Fig. 6.7).\nYou will be surprised to know that\nin many animals fertili sation takes\nplace outside the body of the female.\nIn these animals, fertili sation takes\nplace in water . Let us find out how\nthis happens.\nActivity 6.1\nVisit some ponds or slow-flowing\nstreams during spring or rainy\nseason. Look out for clusters of\nfrog\u2019s eggs floating in water .\nWrite down the colour and size of\nthe eggs.\nDuring spring or rainy season, frogs\nand toads move to ponds and slow-\nflowing streams. When the male and\nfemale come together in water , theAs the eggs are laid, the male\ndeposits sperms over them. Each\nsperm swims randomly in water with\nthe help of its long tail. The sperms\ncome in contact with the eggs. This\nresults in fertili sation. This type of\nfertilis ation in which the fusion of a\nmale and a female gamete takes place\noutside the body of the female is called\nexternal fertili sation . It is very\ncommon in aquatic animals such as\nfish, star fish\n, etc.\nFig. 6.7 :  Eggs of frog\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 70\nDevelopment of Embryo\nFertilisation results in the formation of\nzygote which begins to develop into an\nembryo [Fig. 6.8(a)]. The zygote divides\nrepeatedly to give rise to a ball of cells\n[Fig. 6.8(b)]. The cells then begin to form\ngroups that develop into different tissues\nand organs of the body. This developing\nstructure is termed an embryo . The\nembryo gets embedded in the wall of the\nuterus for further development\n[Fig. 6.8(c)].\nThe embryo continues to develop in\nthe uterus. It gradually develops body\nFig. 6.8 : (a) Zygote formation and development of an embryo from the zygote; (b) Ball of cells\n(enlarged); (c) Embedding of the embryo in the uterus (enlarged)How could a single cell\nbecome such a big\nindividual?\n(b)\n(a)\n(c)Uterus\nEmbedding\nembryoOvary\nOvulationZygote\nUterus\nwall\nDeveloping\nembryo\nThough these animals lay\nhundreds of eggs and release\nmillions of sperms, all the eggs\ndo not get fertilised and develop\ninto new individuals.\nThis is because the eggs and\nsperms get exposed to  water\nmovement, wind and rainfall.\nAlso, there are other animals in\nthe pond which may feed\non eggs. Thus, production\nof large number of eggs and\nsperms is necessary to\nensure fertilisation\nof at least\na few of them.\n2024-25\n\nREPRODUCTION  IN ANIMALS 71parts such as hands, legs, head, eyes,\nears etc. The stage of the embryo in\nwhich all the body parts can be\nidentified is called a foetus (Fig. 6.9).\nWhen the development of the foetus is\ncomplete,  the mother gives birth to\nthe baby.place inside the egg shell during this\nperiod? After the chick is completely\ndeveloped it bursts open the egg shell.\nIn animals which undergo external\nfertilisation, development of the embryo\ntakes place outside the female body. The\nembryos continue to grow within their\negg coverings. After the embryos develop,\nthe eggs hatch. Y\nou must have seen\nnumerous tadpoles swimming in ponds\nand streams.\nViviparous and Oviparous Animals\nWe have learnt that some animals give\nbirth to young ones while some animals\nlay eggs which later develop into young\nones. The animals which give birth to\nyoung ones are called viviparous\nanimals. Those animals which lay eggs\nare called oviparous animals. The\nfollowing activity will help you\nunderstand better and differentiate\nbetween viviparous and oviparous\nanimals.\nActivity 6.2\nTry to observe eggs of the following\norganisms \u2013 fr og, lizar d, butter fly\nor moth, hen and crow or any other\nbir\nd. Were you able to observe eggs\nof all of them? Make drawings of  the\neggs that you have observed.\nThe eggs of a few animals are easy\nto observe because their mothers lay\nthem outside their bodies. These are\nexamples of oviparous animals. But you\nwould not be able to collect the eggs of\na dog, cow or cat. This is because they\ndo not lay eggs. The mother gives birth\nto the young ones. These are examples\nof viviparous animals.Internal fertilisation takes place in\nhens also. But, do hens give birth to\nbabies like human beings and cows? Y ou\nknow that they do not. Then, how are\nchicks born? Let us find out.\nSoon after fertilisation, the zygote\ndivides repeatedly and travels down the\noviduct. As it travels down, many\nprotective layers are formed around it.\nThe hard shell that you see in a hen\u2019s\negg is one such pr otective layer .\nAfter the hard shell is formed around\nthe developing embryo, the hen finally\nlays the egg. The embryo takes about 3\nweeks to develop into a chick. Y ou must\nhave seen the hen sitting on the eggs to\nprovide sufficient warmth. Did you know\nthat development of the chick takesFig. 6.9 :  Foetus in the uterusUterus\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 72Can you now give some more\nexamples of viviparous and oviparous\nanimals?\nYoung Ones to Adults\nThe new individuals which are born or\nhatched from the eggs continue to grow\ntill they become adults. In some\nanimals, the young ones may look very\ndifferent from the adults. The life cycle\nof frog is shown in Fig. 6.10.\nObserve the different stages of frog\nstarting from the egg to the adult stage.\nWe find that ther e are thr ee distinct\nstages, that is, egg \u2192 tadpole (larva) \u2192\nadult. Don\u2019t the tadpoles look so\ndifferent from the adults? Can you\nimagine that these tadpoles would some\nday become frogs?The tadpoles transform into adults\ncapable of jumping and swimming. The\ntransformation of the larva into an adult\nthrough drastic changes is called\nmetamorphosis . What about the\nchanges that we observe in our body as\nwe grow? Do you think we too undergo\nmetamorphosis? In human beings,\nbody parts similar to those present in\nthe adults are present from the time\nof birth.\n6.3 Asexual Reproduction\nSo far , we have lear nt about r eproduction\nin some familiar animals. But what\nabout very small animals like hydra and\nmicroscopic organisms like amoeba? Do\nyou know how they reproduce?

These bulges are the\ndeveloping new individuals and they are\ncalled buds. Recall the presence of buds\nin yeast. In hydra too the new individuals\ndevelop as outgrowths from a single\nparent. This type of reproduction in\nwhich only a single parent is involved is\ncalled asexual reproduction . Since new\nindividuals develop from the buds in\nhydra, this type of asexual reproduction\nis called budding .\nAnother method of asexual\nreproduction is observed in the\nmicroscopic organism, amoeba. Let us\nsee how this happens.\nYou have alr eady lear nt about the\nstructur e of amoeba. Y ou will r ecall that\namoeba is a single-celled organism\n[Fig. 6.12(a)]. It begins the process of\nreproduction by the division of its\nnucleus into two nuclei [Fig. 6.12(b)].\nThis is followed by division of its body\ninto two, each part receiving a nucleus\n[Fig. 6.12(c)]. Finally, two amoebae are\nproduced from one parent amoeba\n[Fig. 6.12(d)]. This type of asexual\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 74Story of Dolly, the Clone\nCloning is the production of an exact copy of a cell, any other living part, or a\ncomplete organism. Cloning of an animal was successfully performed for the first\ntime by Ian Wilmut and his colleagues at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh,\nScotland. They successfully cloned a sheep named Dolly [Fig. 6.13 (c)]. Dolly was\nborn on 5th July 1996 and was the first mammal to be cloned.\n(a) Finn Dorsett sheep (b) Scottish blackface ewe (c) Dolly\nFig. 6.13\nDuring the process of cloning Dolly, a cell was collected from the mammary gland\nof a female Finn Dorsett sheep [Fig. 6.13 (a)]. Simultaneously, an egg was obtained\nfrom a Scottish blackface ewe [Fig. 6.13 (b)]. The nucleus was removed from the\negg. Then, the nucleus of the mammary gland cell from the Finn Dorsett sheep\nwas inserted into the egg of the Scottish blackface ewe whose nucleus had been\nremoved. The egg thus produced was implanted into the Scottish blackface ewe.\nDevelopment of this egg followed normally and finally Dolly was born. Though\nDolly was given birth by the Scottish blackface ewe, it was found to be absolutely\nidentical to the Finn Dorsett sheep from which the nucleus was taken. Since the\nnucleus from the egg of the Scottish blackface ewe was removed, Dolly did not\nshow any character of the Scottish blackface ewe. Dolly was a healthy clone of\nthe Finn Dorsett sheep and produced several offspring of her own through normal\nsexual means. Unfortunately, Dolly died on 14th February 2003 due to a certain\nlung disease.\nSince Dolly, several attempts have been made to produce cloned mammals.\nHowever , many die befor e birth or die soon after birth. The cloned animals ar e\nmany-a-times found to be born with severe abnormalities.\nreproduction in which an animal\nreproduces by dividing into two\nindividuals is called binary fission .\nApart from budding and binary fission,there are other methods by which a\nsingle parent reproduces young ones.\nYou will study about these in your\nhigher classes.\n2024-25\n\nREPRODUCTION  IN ANIMALS 75\n KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS\nASEXUAL\nREPRODUCTION\nBINARY FISSION\nBUDDING\nEGGS\nEMBRYO\nEXTERNAL\nFERTILISA TION\nFERTILISA TION\nFOETUS\nINTERNAL\nFERTILISA TION\nMETAMORPHOSIS\nOVIPAROUS ANIMALS\nSEXUAL\nREPRODUCTION\nSPERMS\nVIVIP AROUS ANIMALS\nZYGOTE WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\n\u00dcThere are two modes by which animals repro-\nduce.

They were wandering in\ngroups from place to place in search\nof food and shelter . They ate raw\nfruits and vegetables and started\nhunting animals for food. Later , they\ncould cultivate land and produce rice,\nwheat and other food crops. Thus,\nwas born \u2018Agriculture\u2019.\nWhen plants of the same kind are\ncultivated at one place on a large scale,\nit is called a crop. For example, crop of\nwheat means that all the plants grown\nin a field are that of wheat.\nYou alr eady know that cr ops ar e of\ndifferent types like cereals, vegetables\nand fruits.

Despite this diversity,\ntwo broad cropping patterns can be\nidentified. These are:\n(i) Kharif Crops : The crops which are\nsown in the rainy season are called\nkharif crops. The rainy season in India\nis generally fr om June to September .\nPaddy, maize, soyabean, groundnut and\ncotton are kharif crops.\n(ii) Rabi Crops : The crops grown in the\nwinter season (October to March) are\ncalled rabi crops. Examples of rabi\ncrops are wheat, gram, pea, mustard\nand linseed.\nBesides these, pulses and vegetables\nare grown during summer at many\nplaces.\n1.2Basic Practices of Crop\nProductionto as agricultural practices  which are\nlisted below:\n(i)Preparation of soil\n(ii)Sowing\n(iii)Adding manure and fertilisers\n(iv)Irrigation\n(v)Protecting from weeds\n(vi)Harvesting\n(vii)Storage\n1.3 Preparation of Soil\nThe preparation of soil is the first step\nbefore growing a crop. One of the most\nimportant tasks in agriculture is to turn\nthe soil and loosen it. This allows the\nroots to penetrate deep into the soil. The\nloose soil allows the roots to breathe\neasily even when they go deep into the\nsoil. Why does the loosening of soil allow\nthe roots to breathe easily?\nThe loosened soil helps in the growth\nof earthworms and microbes present in\nthe soil. These organisms are friends of\nthe farmer since they further turn and\nloosen the soil and add humus to it.\nBut why the soil needs to be turned and\nloosened?\nYou have lear nt  in the pr evious\nclasses that soil contains minerals,\nwater , air and some living organisms.\nIn addition, dead plants and animals\nget decomposed by soil organisms. In\nthis way, various nutrients in the dead\norganisms are released back into the\nsoil. These nutrients are again absorbed\nby plants.\nSince only a few centimetres of the\ntop layer of soil supports plant growth,\nturning and loosening of soil brings the\nnutrient-rich soil to the top so that\nplants can use these nutrients. Thus,Why  paddy can not be\ngrown in the winter season?\nPaddy requires a lot of\nwater . Ther efore, it is gr own\nonly in the rainy season.\nCultivation of crops involves several\nactivities undertaken by farmers over a\nperiod of time. Y ou may find that these\nactivities are similar to those carried out\nby a gardener or even by you when you\ngrow ornamental plants in your house.\nThese activities or tasks are referred\n2024-25\n\nCROP PRODUCTION  AND MANAGEMENT 3turning and loosening of soil is very\nimportant for cultivation of crops.\nThe process of loosening and turning\nof the soil is called  tilling  or ploughing .\nThis is done by using a plough. Ploughs\nare made of wood or iron. If the soil is\nvery dry, it may need watering before\nploughing. The ploughed field may have\nbig clumps of soil called crumbs. It is\nnecessary to break these crumbs.\nLevelling the field is beneficial for\nsowing as well as for irrigation. Levelling\nof soil is done with the help of a leveller .\nSometimes, manure is added to the\nsoil before tilling. This helps in proper\nmixing of manure with soil. The soil is\nmoistened before sowing.\nAgricultural Implements\nBefore sowing the seeds, it is necessary to\nbreak soil clumps to get better yield. This\nis done with the help of various tools.\nThe main tools used for this purpose are\nthe plough, hoe and cultivator .Plough :  This is being used since\nancient times for tilling the soil, adding\nfertili sers to the crop, removing the weeds\nand turning the  soil. This is made of\nwood and is drawn by a pair of bulls or\nother animals  (horses and camels) . It\ncontains a strong triangular iron strip\ncalled ploughshare. The main part of the\nplough is a long log of wood which is\ncalled a ploughshaft. There is a handle\nat one end of the shaft. The other end is\nattached to a beam which is placed on\nthe bulls\u2019 necks. One pair of bulls and a\nman can easily operate the plough\n[Fig. 1.1 (a)].\nThe indigenous wooden plough is\nincreasingly being replaced by iron\nploughs nowadays.\nHoe : It is a simple tool which is used\nfor removing weeds and for loosening\nthe soil. It has a long rod of wood or\niron. A strong, broad and bent plate of\niron is fixed to one of its ends and\nFig. 1.1 (a) :  The plough\nploughshaft\nploughsharebeam\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 4Activity 1.1\nTake a beaker and fill half of it\nwith water .

Damaged seeds\nbecome hollow  and ar e thus lighter .\nTherefore, they float o\nn water .\nThis is a good method for\nseparating good, healthy seeds from\nthe damaged ones.\nBefore sowing , one of the important\ntasks is to know about the tools used\nfor sowing seeds [Fig. 1.2 (a), (b)].\nTraditional tool : The tool used\ntraditionally for sowing seeds is\nshaped like a funnel [Fig. 1.2 (a)]. The\nseeds are filled into the funnel,\npassed down through two or three\npipes having sharp ends. These\nends pierce into the soil and place\nseeds there.Cultivator : Nowadays ploughing is\ndone by tractor -driven cultivator . The\nuse of cultivator saves labour and time.\n[Fig. 1.1 (c)].\nFig. 1.1 (b) : A hoe\nFig. 1.2 (a) :  Traditional method of sowing\nFig.  1.1 (c) :  Cultivator driven by a tractor\n1.4 Sowing\nSowing is an important part of crop\nproduction.

This sows the seeds\nuniformly at equal distance and depth.\nIt ensures that seeds get covered by the\nsoil after sowing. This protects seeds\nfrom being eaten by birds. Sowing by\nusing a seed drill saves time and labour .Fig. 1.2 (b) :  A seed drill\nThere is a nursery near my\nschool. I found that little\nplants were kept in small\nbags. Why are they\nkept like this?\nSeeds  of a few plants\nsuch as paddy are first\ngrown in a nursery. When\nthey grow into seedlings,\nthey are transplanted to\nthe field manually.

This allows plants to get\nI saw a healthy crop growing\nin a farm. In the neighbouring\nfarm, the plants were weak.\nWhy do some plants grow\nbetter than others?sufficient sunlight, nutrients and water\nfrom the soil. At times a few plants\nmay have to be removed to prevent\novercrowding.\n1.5Adding Manure  and\nFertilisers\nThe substances which are added to the\nsoil in the form of nutrients for the\nhealthy growth of plants are called\nmanure  and fertilisers .\nSoil supplies mineral nutrients to the\ncrop plants. These nutrients are\nessential for the growth of plants. In\ncertain areas, farmers grow crop after\ncrop in the same field. The field is never\nleft uncultivated or fallow. Imagine what\nhappens to the nutrients?\nContinuous cultivation of crops\nmakes the soil poor in nutrients.\nTherefore, farmers have to add manure\nto the fields to replenish the soil with\nnutrients. This process is called\nmanuring . Improper or insufficient\nmanuring results in weak plants.\nManure is an organic substance\nobtained from the decomposition of\nplant or animal wastes. Farmers dump\nplant and animal waste in pits at open\nplaces and allow it to decompose. The\ndecomposition is caused by some\nmicroorganisms. The decomposed\nmatter is used as organic manure.\nYou have alr eady lear nt about\nvermicomposting in Class VI.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 6Activity 1.2\nTake moong  or gram seeds and\ngerminate them.

How are\nthey different from manure? Fertilisers\nare produced in factories. Some\nexamples of fertilisers are \u2014 urea,\nammonium sulphate, super\nphosphate, potash, NPK (Nitrogen,\nPhosphorus, Potassium).\nThe use of fertilisers has helped\nfarmers to get  better yield of crops\nsuch as wheat, paddy and maize. But\nexcessive use of fertilisers has made\nthe soil less fertile. Fertilisers have  also\nbecome a source of water pollution.\nTherefore, in order to maintain  the\nfertility of the soil, we have to\nsubstitute fertilisers with organic\nmanure or leave the field uncultivated\n(fallow) in between two crops.\nThe use of manure improves soil\ntexture as well as its water retaining\ncapacity. It replenishes the soil with\nnutrients.\nAnother method of replenishing\nthe soil with nutrients is through crop\nrotation . This can be done by growing\ndifferent crops alter nately.  Earlier ,\nfarmers in northern India used to\ngrow legumes as fodder in one season\nand wheat in the next season. This\nhelped in the replenishment of the soil\nwith nitrogen. Farmers are being\nencouraged to adopt this practice.\nIn the previous classes, you have\nlearnt about Rhizobium  bacteria.\nThese are present in the nodules of\nroots of leguminous plants.

This is  because\n/circle6it enhances the water holding\ncapacity of the soil.\n/circle6it makes the soil porous due to which\nexchange of gases becomes easy.\n/circle6it increases the number of friendly\nmicrobes.\n/circle6it improves the texture of the soil.\n1.6 Irrigation\nAll living beings need water to live.\nWater is important for pr oper gr owth\nand development. W ater is absorbed by\nthe plant r oots. Along with water ,\nminerals and fertilisers are also\nabsorbed. Plants contain nearly 90%\nwater . Water is essential because\ngermination of seeds does not take place\nunder dry conditions. Nutrients\ndissolved in water are transported to\neach part of the plant. W ater alsoprotects the crop from both frost and\nhot air currents. To maintain the\nmoisture of the soil for healthy crop\ngrowth, fields have to be watered\nregularly.\nThe supply of water to crops at\nregular intervals is called irrigation . The\ntime and frequency of irrigation varies\nfrom crop to crop, soil to soil and season\nto season. In summer , the fr equency of\nwatering is higher . Why is it so? Could\nit be due to the increased rate of\nevaporation of water from the soil and\nthe leaves?Table 1.1 : Differences between Fertiliser and Manure\nS. No. Fertiliser Manure\n1.

Fertilisers are very rich in Manure is relatively less rich in plant\nplant nutrients like nitrogen, nutrients.\nphosphorus and potassium.\nSources of irrigation : The sources of\nwater for irrigation are\u2014 wells,\ntubewells, ponds, lakes, rivers, dams\nand  canals.I am very careful this\nyear about watering\nthe plants. Last\nsummer my plants\ndried up and died.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 8\nFig. 1.4 (a) :  Moat\nFig. 1.4 (b) :  Chain pump\nFig. 1.4 (d) :  RahatFig. 1.4 (c) : DhekliTraditional Methods of\nIrrigation\nThe water available in wells,\nlakes and canals is lifted up\nby different methods in\ndifferent regions, for taking it\nto the fields.\nCattle or human labour is\nused in these methods. So\nthese methods ar e cheaper ,\nbut less efficient. The various\ntraditional ways are:\n(i)moat (pulle y-system)\n(ii)chain pump\n(iii)dhekli, and\n(iv)rahat\n (Lever system)\n[Figs. 1.4 (a)- (d)].\nPumps are commonly\nused for lifting water . Diesel,\nbiogas, electricity and\nsolar energy is used to run\nthese pumps.\n2024-25\n\nCROP PRODUCTION  AND MANAGEMENT 9Modern Methods of\nIrrigation\nModern methods of irrigation\nhelp us to use water\neconomically. The main\nmethods used are as follows:\n(i)Sprinkler System: This\nsystem is more useful on the\nuneven land where sufficient\nwater is not available. The\nperpendicular pipes, having\nrotating nozzles on top, are\njoined to the main pipeline\nat regular intervals. When\nwater is allowed to flow\nthrough the main pipe under pressure\nwith the help of a pump, it escapes from\nthe rotating nozzles. It gets sprinkled\non the crop as if it is raining.\nSprinkler is very useful for lawns, coffee\nplantation and several other crops\n[Fig. 1.5 (a)].\nFig. 1.5 (b) :  Drip System\nFig. 1.5 (a) :  Sprinkler system\n(ii)Drip system : In this system, the\nwater falls drop by drop directly near\nthe roots. So it is called drip system. It\nis the best technique for watering fruit\nplants,  gardens and trees [Fig. 1.5(b)].\nWater is  not wasted at all. It is a boon in\nregions wher e availability of water is poor .\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 101.7 Pr otection fr om W eeds\nBoojho and Paheli went to a nearby\nwheat field and saw that there were some\nother plants in the field, growing along\nwith wheat plants.\nHave these other\nplants been planted\npurposely?\nIn a field many other undesirable\nplants may grow naturally along with\nthe crop. These undesirable plants are\ncalled weeds .\nThe removal of weeds is called\nweeding. W eeding is necessary since\nweeds compete with the crop plants for\nwater , nutrients, space and light. Thus,\nthey affect the growth of the crop. Some\nweeds inter fere even in harvesting and\nmay be poisonous for animals and\nhuman beings.\nFarmers adopt many ways to remove\nweeds and contr ol their growth. T illing\nbefore sowing of crops helps in\nuprooting and killing of weeds, which\nmay then dry up and get mixed with\nthe soil. The best time for the removal\nof weeds is before they produce flowers\nand seeds. The manual removal includes\nphysical removal of weeds by uprooting\nor cutting them close to the ground,\nfrom time to time. This is done with the\nhelp of a \nkhurpi. A seed drill [Fig. 1.2(b)]\nis also used to uproot weeds.\nWeeds ar e also controlled by using\ncertain chemicals, called weedicides ,\nlike 2,4-D. These are sprayed in the\nfields to kill the weeds. They do not\ndamage the crops. The weedicides are\ndiluted with water to the extent required\nand sprayed in the fields with a sprayer .\n(Fig. 1.6).\nDo weedicides have any\neffect on the person handling\nthe weedicide sprayer?Fig. 1.6 : Spraying weedicide\nAs already mentioned, the  weedicides\nare sprayed during the vegetative growth\nof weeds before flowering and seed\nformation. Spraying of weedicides may\naffect the health of  farmer s. So they\nshould use these chemicals very carefully.\nThey should cover their nose and mouth\nwith a piece of cloth during spraying of\nthese chemicals.\n1.8Harvesting\nHarvesting of a crop is an important\ntask. The cutting of crop after it is\nmature is called harvesting . In\nharvesting, crops are pulled out or cut\nclose to the ground. It usually takes 3\nto 4 months for a cereal crop to mature.\nHarvesting in our\ncountry is either done\nmanually by sickle\n(Fig. 1.7) or by a machine\ncalled harvester . In the\nharvested crop, the grain\nseeds need to be separatedFig. 1.7 :\nSickle\n2024-25\n\nCROP PRODUCTION  AND MANAGEMENT 11from the chaff. This process is called\nthreshing . This is carried out with the\nhelp of a machine called \u2018combine\u2019 which\nis in fact a  harvester as well as a  thresher\n(Fig. 1.8).\nFig. 1.8 :  Combine\nAfter harvesting, sometimes\nstubs are left in the field, which\nare burnt by farmers. Paheli is\nworried. She knows that it\ncauses pollution. It may also\ncatch fire and damage the crops\nlying in the fields.\nHarvest Festivals\nAfter three or four months of hard\nwork there comes the day of the\nharvest. The sight of golden fields\nof standing crop, laden with grain,\nfills the hearts of farmers with joy\nand a sense of well -being. The\nefforts of the past season have\nborne fruit and it is time to relax\nand enjoy a little. The period of\nharvest is, thus, of great joy and\nhappiness in all parts of India.\nMen and women celebrate it with\ngreat enthusiasm. Special\nfestivals associated with the\nharvest season are Pongal,\nBaisakhi, Holi, Diwali, Nabanya\nand Bihu.\n1.9Storage\nStorage of produce is an important task.\nIf the harvested grains are to be kept\nfor longer time, they should be safe\nfrom moisture, insects, rats and\nmicroorganisms. Harvested grains have\nmore moisture. If freshly harvested\ngrains (seeds) are stored without drying,\nthey may get spoilt or attacked by\norganisms, making them unfit for use\nor for germination. Hence, before\nstoring them, the grains are properly\ndried in the sun to reduce the moisture\nin them. This prevents the attack by\ninsect pests, bacteria and fungi.Farmers with small holdings of land\ndo the separation of grain and chaff by\nwinnowing (Fig. 1.9).

However , large scale\nstorage of grains is done in silos  and\ngranaries  to protect them from pests\nlike rats and insects [Fig. 1.10 (a)\nand (b)].\nDried neem leaves are used for\nstoring food grains at home. For storing\nlarge quantities of grains in big\ngodowns, specific chemical treatments\nare required to protect them from pests\nand microorganisms.Activity 1.3\nMake the following Table in your\nnote book and complete it.\nS.No. Food Sources\n1.

Do you\nstill hear the sound?  Touch the\nplate after it stops producing sound.\nCan you feel the vibrations now?As you learnt in Class VII the to and\nfro or back and forth motion of an\nobject is called vibration . When a\ntightly stretched band is plucked, it\nvibrates and produces sound. When it\nstops vibrating, it does not produce\nany sound.\nActivity 10.3\nTake a metal dish.

Put your hand on\nyour throat as shown in Fig. 10.8. Do\nyou feel any vibrations?\nIn humans, the sound is produced\nby the voice box  or the larynx . Put your\nfingers on the throat and find a hard\nbump that seems to move when you\nswallow. This part of the body is known\nas the voice box. It is at the upper end\nof the windpipe. Two vocal cords,\n are\nstretched across the voice box or larynx\nin such a way that it leaves a narrow\nslit between them for the passage of air\n(Fig.10.8).\nFig. 10.7 :  Jaltrang\nWhen we pluck the string of an\ninstrument, like the sitar , the sound\nthat we hear is not only that of the\nstring. The whole instrument is forced\nto vibrate, and it is the sound of the\nvibration of the instrument that we\nhear. Similarly, when we strike the\nmembrane of a mridangam , the sound\nthat we hear is not only that of the\nmembrane but of the whole body of\nthe instrument.When we speak, does\nany part of our body\nvibrate?\nFig.10.8 : Voice box in humans\nWhen the lungs force air through the\nslit, the vocal cords vibrate, producing\nsound.

Now blow air through the gap\nbetween them [Fig. 10.9(a)]. As the\nair blows through the stretched\nrubber strips, a sound is produced.\nYou can also take a piece of paper\nwith a narrow slit and hold it\nbetween your fingers as shown in\nFig. 10.9 (b). Now blow through the\nslit and listen to the sound. Our\nvocal cords produce sound in a\nsimilar manner .\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 10.9 (a), (b) : Working of vocal cor ds\nThe vocal cords in men are about\n20 mm long. In women these are about\n15mm long. Children have very short\nvocal cords. This is the reason why\nthe voices of men, women and\nchildren are different.\n10.3 Sound Needs a Medium\nfor Propagation\nWhen you call up your friend who is\nstanding at a distance, your friend is\nable to hear your voice. How does the\nsound propagate or  travel to her?\nActivity 10.7\nTake a metal  or glass tumbler . Make\nsure that it is dry. Place a cell phone\nin it. (Remember that the cell phone\nmust not be kept in water .)

Listen to the ring while\nsucking air fr om the tumbler .\nDoes the sound become fainter\nas you suck air?\nRemove the tumbler from your\nmouth. Does the sound become\nloud again?\nCan you think of an explanation? Is\nit possible that the decreasing amount\nof air in the tumbler had something to\ndo with decreasing loudness  of the ring?\nIndeed, if you had been able to suck\nall the air in the tumbler , you will not\nlisten any sound . Actually, sound needs\na medium to travel. When air has been\nremoved completely from a vessel, it is said\nthat there is  a vacuum in the vessel. The\nsound  cannot travel through a  vacuum.\nDoes sound travel in liquids? Let us\nfind out.\nActivity 10.8\nTake a bucket or a bathtub. Fill it\nwith clean water . Take a small bell\nin one hand. Shake this bell inside\nthe water to produce sound. Make\nsure that the bell does not touch\nthe body of the bucket or the tub.Oh ! That is how whales\nand dolphins might be\ncommunicating under\nwater .\nFig. 10.11  : Sound travelling through waterFig. 10.12 : Sound travelling through a\nmetre scale\nCan you hear the sound of the\nscratching? Ask your friends\naround you if they were able to hear\nthe same sound?Let us find out if sound can travel\nthrough solids also.\nActivity 10.9\nTake a metre scale or a long metal\nrod and hold its one end to your\near. Ask your friend to gently\nscratch or tap at the other end of\nthe scale (Fig. 10.12).\n2024-25\n\nSOUND 129You can also per form the above\nactivity by placing your ear at one end\nof a long wooden or metallic table and\nasking your friend to gently scratch the\nother end of the table (Fig. 10.13).\nFig. 10.13 :  Sound can travel through solids\nWe find that sound can travel\nthrough wood or metal. In fact, sound\ncan travel thr ough any solid. Y ou can\nperform inter esting activities to show\nthat sound can also travel through\nstrings. Have you ever made a toy\ntelephone (Fig. 10.14). Can you say that\nsound can travel through strings?\nFig. 10.14 : A toy telephone\nWe have lear nt so far that vibrating\nobjects produce sound and it is carried\nin all directions in a medium. The\nmedium could be a gas, a liquid or a\nsolid. How do we hear it?\nFig. 10.15 : Understanding action of an eardrum10.4 We Hear Sound thr ough\nOur Ears\nThe shape of the outer part of the ear is\nlike a funnel. When sound enters it, it\ntravels down a canal at the end of which\nthere is a thin stretched membrane. It\nis called the eardrum. It per forms an\nimportant function. To understand what\nthe eardrum does, let us build a tin-can\nmodel of the eardrum.\nActivity 10.10\nTake a plastic or tin-can. Cut its\nends. Stretch a piece of rubber\nballoon across one end of the can\nand fasten it with a rubber band.\nPut four or five grains of dry cereal\non the str etched rubber . Now ask\nyour friend to speak \u201cHurrey,\nHurrey\u201d from the open end\n(Fig.10.15). Observe what  happens\nto the grain. Why do the grains\njump up and down?\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 130The eardrum is like a stretched\nrubber sheet. Sound vibrations make\nthe eardrum vibrate (Fig. 10.16). The\neardrum sends vibrations to the inner\near. From ther e, the signal goes to the\nbrain. That is how we hear .You have alr eady lear nt in earlier classes\nabout the oscillatory motion and its\ntime period.\nThe number of oscillations  per\nsecond is called the frequency  of\noscillation. Frequency is expressed in\nhertz . Its symbol is Hz. A frequency of\n1 Hz is one oscillation per second. If an\nobject oscillates 20 times in one second,\nwhat would be its frequency?\nYou can r ecognise many familiar\nsounds without seeing the objects\nproducing them. How is it possible?\nThese sounds must be different to\nenable you to recognise them. Have you\never thought what factors make them\ndifferent?  Amplitude  and frequency are\ntwo important properties of any sound.\nCan we differentiate sounds on the basis\nof their amplitudes and frequencies?\nLoudness and Pitch\nActivity 10.11\nTake a metallic tumbler and a\ntablespoon. Strike the tablespoon\ngently at the brim of the tumbler .Fig. 10.16 : Human ear\nFig. 10.17 : Thermocol ball touching the\nvibrating glass tumblerWe must NEVER put a sharp,\npointed or hard thing into our\near. It can damage the\neardrum. The damaged\neardrum can impair hearing.\n10.5 Amplitude, T ime Period\nand Frequency of a\nVibration\nWe have lear nt that the to and fr o motion\nof an object is known as vibration. This\nmotion is also called oscillatory motion .Eardrum\nInner ear\n2024-25\n\nSOUND 131Hear the sound produced. Now bang\nthe spoon on the tumbler and hear\nthe sound produced again. Is the\nsound louder when the tumbler is\nstruck hard?\nNow suspend a small thermocol\nball touching the rim of the tumbler\n(Fig. 10.17). Vibrate the tumbler by\nstriking it. See how far the ball is\ndisplaced. The displacement of the\nball is a measure of the amplitude\nof vibration of the tumbler .\nNow, strike the tumbler gently\nand then a little har der. Compar e\nthe amplitudes of vibrations of the\ntumbler in the two cases. In which\ncase is the amplitude larger?\nLoudness of sound is proportional to\nthe square of the amplitude of the\nvibration producing the sound. For\nexample, if the amplitude becomes\ntwice, the loudness increases by a\nfactor of 4. The loudness is expressed\nin a unit called decibel (dB). The\nfollowing table gives some idea of the\nloudness of sound coming from\nvarious sources.\nNormal breathing 10 dB\nSoft whisper (at 5m) 30 dB\nNormal conversation 60 dB\nBusy traffic 70 dB\nAverage factory 80 dB\nAbove 80 dB the noise becomes\nphysically painful.I wonder why my voice\nis different from that of\nmy teacher .\nCompare the sound of a baby with\nthat of an adult. Is there any difference?\nEven if two sounds are equally loud,\nthey differ in some way. Let us see how.\nFig. 10.18 : Frequency determines the\npitch of a soundThe loudness of sound depends on\nits amplitude. When the amplitude of\nvibration is large, the sound produced\nis loud. When the amplitude is small,\nthe sound produced is feeble.The frequency determines the\nshrillness or pitch  of a sound. If the\nfrequency of vibration is higher we say\nthat the sound is shrill and has a higher\npitch. If the frequency of vibration is\nlower , we say that the sound has a lower\npitch. For example, a drum vibrates with\na low frequency. Therefore, it produces\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 132a low-pitched sound. On the other\nhand, a whistle has a high frequency\nand therefore, produces a sound of\nhigher pitch (Fig. 10.18). A bird makes\na high-pitched sound whereas a lion\nmakes a low-pitched r oar. However , the\nroar of a lion is very loud while the\nsound of the bird is quite feeble.\nEvery day you hear the voices of\nchildren and adults. Do you find any\ndifference in their voices? Can you say\nthat the frequency of the voice of a child\nis higher than that of an adult?\nUsually the voice of a woman has\na higher  frequency than that of a\nman.\n10.6 Audible and Inaudible\nSounds\nWe know that we need a vibrating body\nfor the production of sound. Can we\nhear the sound of all vibrating bodies?\nThe fact is that sounds of frequencies\nless than about 20 vibrations per second\n(20 Hz) cannot be detected by the  human\near. Such sounds ar e called inau dible.\nOn the higher side, sounds of  frequencies\nhigher\n than about 20,000 vibrations per\nsecond (20 kHz) are also not audible to\nthe  human ear . Thus, for human ear,\nthe range of audible frequencies is\nroughly from 20 to 20,000 Hz.\nSome animals can hear sounds of\nfrequencies higher than 20,000 Hz.\nDogs have this ability. The police use\nhigh frequency whistles which dogs can\nhear but humans cannot.\nThe ultrasound equipment, familiar\nto us for investigating and tracking\nmany medical problems, works at\nfrequencies higher than 20,000 Hz.10.7 Noise and Music\nWe hear dif ferent types of sounds\naround us. Is the sound always\npleasing? Does a sound sometimes\ncause discomfort to you? Some sounds\nare pleasant to the ear , wher eas some\nare not.\nSuppose construction work is going\non in your neighbourhood. Are the\nsounds coming from the construction\nsite pleasing ? Do you enjoy the sounds\nproduced by horns of buses and trucks?\nSuch unpleasant sounds are called\nnoise . In a classroom, if all the students\nspeak together , what would the sound\nproduced be called?\nOn the other hand you enjoy sounds\nfrom musical instruments.  Musical\nsound is one which is pleasing to the\near. Sound pr\noduced by a harmonium\nis a musical sound. The string of a sitar\nalso gives out a musical sound.  But, if\na musical sound becomes too loud,\nwould it remain melodious ?\n10.8 Noise Pollution\nYou alr eady know about air pollution.\nPresence of unwanted gases and\nparticles in air is called air pollution.\nSimilarly, presence of excessive or\nunwanted sounds in the environment\nis called noise pollution. Can you list\nsome sources of noise pollution? Major\ncauses of noise pollution are sounds of\nvehicles, explosions including bursting\nof crackers, machines, loudspeakers etc.\nWhat sources in the home may lead to\nnoise? Television and transistor radio\nat high volumes, some kitchen\nappliances, desert coolers, air\nconditioners, all contribute to noise\npollution.\n2024-25\n\nSOUND 133Hearing Impairment\nTotal hearing impairment, which is rare, is usually from birth itself. Partial\ndisability is generally the result of a disease, injury or age. Children with\nimpaired hearing need special care. By learning sign language, such children\ncan communicate effectively. Because speech develops as the direct result of\nhearing, a child with a hearing loss may have defective speech also.\nTechnological devices for the hearing-impaired have made it possible for such\npersons to improve their quality of life. Society can do much to  improve the\nliving environment for the hearing-impaired and help them live normal lives.What are the Harms of Noise\nPollution?\nDo you know that presence of excessive\nnoise in the surroundings may cause\nmany health related problems. Lack of\nsleep, hypertension (high blood-\npressure), anxiety and many more health\ndisorders may be caused by noise\npollution. A person who is exposed to a\nloud sound continuously may get\ntemporary or even permanent\nimpairment of hearing.\nMeasures to Limit Noise Pollution\nTo control noise, we  must control the\nsources of noise. How can this be\nachieved? For this, silencing devicesmust be installed in air  craft engines,\ntransport vehicles, industrial\nmachines and home appliances.\nHow can the noise pollution be\ncontrolled in a residential area?\nAll noisy operations must be\nconducted away from any residential\narea. Noise producing industries\nshould be set up away from such\nareas. Use of automobile horns\nshould be minimi s\ned. TV and music\nsystems should be run at low\nvolumes. Trees must be planted along\nthe roads and around buildings to\ncut down on the sounds reaching the\nresidents, thus reducing the harmful\neffects of noise pollution.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 134\n KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS\nAMPLITUDE\nEARDRUM\nFREQUENCY\nhertz  (Hz)\nLARYNX\nLOUDNESS\nNOISE\nOSCILLA TION\nPITCH\nTIME PERIOD\nVIBRA TION\nVOICE BOX\nWIND PIPE WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\n\u00dcSound is produced by vibrating objects.\n\u00dcIn human beings, the vibration of the vocal\ncords produces sound.\n\u00dcSound travels through a medium (gas, liquid\nor solid).

However ,\nthere are other living organisms\naround us which we normally cannot\nsee. These are called microorganisms\nor microbes . For example, you might\nhave observed that during the rainy\nseason moist bread gets spoilt and its\nsurface gets cover ed with gr eyish white\npatches. Observe these patches through\na magnifying glass. Y ou will see tiny,\nblack rounded structures. Do you know\nwhat these structures are and where d o\nthese come from?\n2.1 Microorganisms\nActivity 2.1\nCollect some moist soil from the\nfield in a beaker and add water to\nit. After the soil particles have\nsettled  down , observe a drop of\nwater from the beaker under a\nmicroscope. What do you see ?\nActivity 2.2\nTake a few drops of water from a\npond. Spread on a glass slide and\nobserve through a microscope.\nDo you find tiny organisms moving\naround?These observations show that water\nand soil are full of tiny organisms,\nthough not all of them fall into the\ncategory of microbes. These\nmicroorganisms or microbes are so\nsmall in size that they cannot be seen\nwith the unaided eye. Some of these,\nsuch as the fungus that grows on bread,\ncan be seen with a magnifying glass.\nOthers cannot be seen without the help\nof a microscope. That is why these are\ncalled microorganisms or microbes.\nMicroorganisms are classified into\nfour major groups. These groups are\nbacteria , fungi ,  protozoa  and some\nalgae . Some of these common\nmicroorganisms are shown in\nFigs. 2.1 - 2.4.\nViruses are also microscopic but are\ndifferent from other microorganisms .\nThey, however , reproduce only inside the\ncells of the host organism, which may be\na bacterium, plant or animal. Some of the\nviruses are shown in Fig. 2.5. Common\nailments like cold, influenza (flu) and\nmost coughs are caused by viruses.\nSerious diseases like polio and chicken\npox are also caused by viruses.\nDiseases like dysentery and malaria\nare caused by protozoa(protozoans)\nwhereas  typhoid and tuberculosis (TB)\nare bacterial diseases.\nYou have lear nt about some of\nthese microorganisms in Classes VI\nand VII.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 18Fig. 2.4 :  Fungi\nFig. 2.1:  Bacteria\nChlamydomonas Spirogyra\nFig. 2.2 :  AlgaeAmoeba\nParamecium\nFig. 2.3 :  Protozoa\nBread mould PenicilliumAspergillus\n2024-25\n\nMICROORGANISMS  : FRIEND AND FOE 192.2Where do Microorganisms\nLive?\nMicroorganisms may be single-celled\nlike bacteria, some algae and protozoa,\nor multicellular , such as many algae and\nfungi. They live in all types of\nenvironment, ranging from ice cold\nclimate to hot springs; and deserts to\nmarshy lands. They are also found\ninside the bodies of animals including\nhumans. Some microorganisms\ngrow on other organisms while others\nexist freely.\n2.3 Microorganisms and Us\nMicroorganisms play an important role\nin our lives. Some of them are beneficial\nin many ways whereas some others are\nharmful and cause diseases. Let us\nstudy about them in detail.Microorganisms have been used for\nthe production of alcohol since ages.Friendly Microorganisms\nMicroorganisms are used for various\npurposes. They are used in the\npreparation of curd, bread and cake.\nCurd contains several micro-\norganisms. Of these, the bacterium ,\nLactobacillus   promotes the formation\nof curd. It multiplies in milk and\nconverts it into curd. Bacteria are also\ninvolved in the making of cheese,\npickles and many other food items. An\nimportant ingredient of rava (sooji)\nidlis and \nbhaturas  is curd. Can you\nguess why? Bacteria and yeast are also\nhelpful for fermentation of rice idlis\nand dosa batter .\nFig. 2.5 :  Viruses\nI saw that my mother\nadded a little curd to warm\nmilk to set curd for the\nnext day. I wonder why?They are also used in cleaning up\nof the environment. For example, the\norganic wastes (vegetable peels, remains\nof animals,  faeces , etc.) are broken\ndown into harmless and usable\nsubstances by bacteria. Recall that\nbacteria are also used in the\npreparation of medicines. In agriculture\nthey are used to increase soil fertility\nby fixing nitrogen.\nMaking of Curd and Bread\nYou have lear nt in Class VII that milk is\nturned into curd by bacteria.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 20spoon of yeast powder to the sugar\nsolution. Keep it covered in a warm\nplace for 4-5 hours. Now smell the\nsolution.  Can you get a smell?\nLouis Pasteur\ndiscovered\nfermentation\nin 1857.\nIn 1929, Alexander\nFleming was working\non a culture of disease-\ncausing bacteria.\nSuddenly he found the\nspores of a little green mould in one of\nhis culture plates. He observed that\nthe presence of mould prevented the\ngrowth of bacteria. In fact, it also killed\nmany of these bacteria. From this the\nmould penicillin was prepared.\nThis is the smell of alcohol as sugar\nhas been converted into alcohol by yeast.\nThis process of conversion of sugar into\nalcohol is known as fermentation.Activity 2.3\nTake \u00bd kg flour ( atta or maida ),\nadd some sugar and mix with\nwarm water . Add a small amount\nof yeast powder and knead to\nmake a soft dough. What do you\nobserve after two hours?

Bubbles of the gas fill the\ndough and increase its volume (Fig. 2.6).\nThis is the basis of the use of  yeast in\nthe baking industry for making breads,\npastries and cakes.\nCommercial Use of Microorganisms\nMicroorganisms are used for the large scale\nproduction of alcohol, wine and acetic acid\n(vinegar). Y east is used for commer cial\nproduction of alcohol and wine. For this\npurpose yeast is grown on natural sugars\npresent in grains like barley, wheat, rice,\ncrushed fruit juices , etc.\nActivity 2.4\nTake a 500 mL beaker filled upto\n\u00be with water . Dissolve 2-3\nteaspoons of sugar in it. Add half a\nMedicinal Use of Microorganisms\nWhen ever you fall ill the doctor may\ngive you some antibiotic tablets,\ncapsules or injections such as of\npenicillin. The source of these\nmedicines is microorganisms. These\nmedicines kill or stop the growth of the\ndisease -causing microorganisms. Such\nmedicines are called antibiotics . These\ndays a number of antibiotics are being\nproduced from bacteria and fungi.\nStreptomycin, tetracycline and\nerythromycin are some of the\n2024-25\n\nMICROORGANISMS  : FRIEND AND FOE 21commonly known antibiotics which are\nmade from fungi and bacteria. The\nantibiotics are manufactured by\ngrowing specific microorganisms and\nare used to cure a variety of diseases.\nAntibiotics are even mixed with the\nfeed of livestock and poultry to check\nmicrobial infection in animals. They are\nalso used to control many plant\ndiseases.\nIt is important to remember that\nantibiotics should be taken only on\nthe advi ce of a qualified doctor . Also\nyou must complete  the course\nprescribed by the doctor . If you take\nantibiotics when not needed or in\nwrong doses, it may make the drug\nless effective when you might need\nit in future. Also antibiotics taken\nunnecessarily may kill the beneficial\nbacteria in the body. Antibiotics,\nhowever , are not ef fective against\ncold and flu as these are caused by\nviruses.\nVaccinefrom the disease-causing microbes for\never. This is how a vaccine works.\nSeveral diseases, including cholera,\ntuberculosis, smallpox and hepatitis can\nbe prevented by vaccination.\nEdward Jenner\ndiscovered the\nvaccine for small-\npox in 1798.\nWhy are children/infants\ngiven vaccination?\nWhen a disease-carrying microbe enters\nour body, the body produces antibodies\nto fight the invader . The body also\nremembers how to fight the microbe if\nit enters again. If dead or weakened\nmicrobes are introduced in to a healthy\nbody , the body fights and kills\nthe invading bacteria  by producing\nsuitable antibodies. The antibodies\nremain in the body and we are protected\nIn your childhood, you must have\nbeen given injections to protect\nyourself against several diseases.\nCan you prepare a list of these\ndiseases? Y ou may take help fr om\nyour parents.\nIt is essential to protect all children\nagainst these diseases. Necessary\nvaccines are available in the nearby\nhospitals. Y ou might have seen the\nadvertisement on TV and newspapers\nregarding protection of children against\npolio under the Pulse Polio Programme.\nPolio drops given to children are\nactually a vaccine.\nA worldwide campaign against\nsmallpox has finally led to its eradication\nfrom most parts of the world.\nThese days vaccines are made on a\nlarge scale from microorganisms  to\nprotect humans and other animals from\nseveral diseases.\nIncreasing Soil Fertility\nSome bacteria  (Fig. 2.7) are able to fix\nnitrogen from the atmosphere to enrich\nsoil with nitrogen and increase its\nfertility. These microbes are commonly\ncalled biological nitrogen fixers.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 22Cleaning the Environment\nBoojho and Paheli had observed the\nschool gardener making manure. Along\nwith their friends, they collected wastes\nof plants, vegetables and fruit s from\nnearby houses and  gardens. They put\nthem in a pit meant for waste disposal.\nAfter some time , it decomposed and got\nconverted to manure. Boojho and\nPaheli wanted to know how this had\nhappen ed.\nActivity 2.5\nTake two pots and fill each pot half\nwith soil. Mark them A and B. Put\nplant waste in pot A and things like\npolythene bags, empty glass bottles\nand broken plastic toys in pot B.\nPut the pots aside. Observe them\nafter 3-4 weeks.\nDo you find any difference in the\ncontents of the two pots? If so, what is\nthe dif ference? Y ou will find that plant\nwaste  in pot A, has been decomposed.\nHow did this happen? The plant waste\nhas been converted into manure by the\naction of microbes. The nutrientsreleased in the process can be used by\nthe plants again.\nDid you notice that in pot B , the\npolythene bags, empty glasses, bottles\nand broken toy parts did not undergo\nany such change? The microbes could\nnot \u2018act\u2019 on them and convert them into\nmanure.\nYou often see lar ge amounts of\ndead organic matter in the form of\ndecaying plants and sometimes dead\nanimals on the gr ound. Y\nou find\nthat they disappear after some time.\nThis is because the microorganisms\ndecompose dead organic waste of plants\nand animals converting them into\nsimple substances. These substances\nare again used by other plants and\nanimals.  Thus, microorganisms can\nbe used to degrade the harmful and\nsmelly substances and thereby clean\nup the environment.\n2.4Harmful Microorganisms\nMicroorganisms are harmful in many\nways. Some of the microorganisms\ncause diseases in human beings, plants\nand animals. Such disease-causingFig. 2.7 :  The Nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria (blue green algae)\n2024-25\n\nMICROORGANISMS  : FRIEND AND FOE 23\nmicroorganisms are called pathogens.\nSome microorganisms spoil food,\nclothing and leather . Let us study mor e\nabout their harmful activities.\nDisease causing Microorganisms\nin Humans\nPathogens enter our body through the\nair we breathe, the water we drink or\nthe food we eat. They can also get\ntransmitted by direct contact with an\ninfected person or carried by an animal.\nMicrobial diseases that can spread from\nan infected person to a healthy person\nthrough air , water , food or physical\ncontact are called communicable\ndiseases . Examples of such diseases\ninclude cholera, common cold, chicken\npox and tuberculosis.\nWhen a person suffering from\ncommon cold sneezes, fine droplets of\nmoisture carrying thousands of viruses\nare spread in the air . The virus may enter\nthe body of a healthy person while\nbreathing and cause infection.There are some insects and animals\nwhich act as carriers  of disease-\ncausing microbes. Housefly is one such\ncarrier . The flies sit on the garbage and\nanimal excreta. Pathogens stick to their\nbodies. When these flies sit on uncovered\nfood they may transfer the pathogens.\nWhoever eats the contaminated food is\nlikely to get sick. So, it is advisable to\nalways keep food covered. Avoid\nconsuming uncovered items of food.\nAnother example of a carrier is the\nfemale Anopheles  mosquito (Fig. 2.8),\nwhich carries the parasite of malaria\n(Plasmodium). Female Aedes  mosquito\nacts as carrier of dengue virus.\nHow can we control the spread of malaria\nor dengue?\nThen how do you\nprevent the spread of\ncommunicable\ndiseases?\n We should keep a\nhandkerchief on the\nnose and mouth while\nsneezing. It is better to\nkeep a distance from\ninfected persons.\nFig. 2.8 : Female Anopheles mosquito\nWhy does the teacher\nkeep telling us not\nto let water collect\nanywhere in the\nneighbourhood?\nAll mosquitoes br eed in water . Hence,\none should not let water collect\nanywhere, in coolers, tyres, flower pot,\netc. By keeping the surroundings clean\nand dry we can prevent mosquitoes from\nbreeding.

For example, anthrax\nis a dangerous human and cattle\ndisease caused by a bacterium. Foot\nand mouth disease of cattle is caused\nby a virus.\nDisease causing Microorganisms\nin Plants\nSeveral microorganisms cause\ndiseases in plants like wheat,  rice, potato,\nsugarcane, orange,  apple and others.\nThe diseases  reduce the yield of crops.\nSee Table 2.2 for some such plant\ndiseases.

The\ndoctor said that this condition could be\ndue to food poisoning.make the food poisonous causing\nserious illness and even death. So, it\nis very important that we preserve\nfood to prevent it from being spoilt.\n2.5 Food Preservation\nIn Chapter 1, we have learnt about the\nmethods used to preserve and store food\ngrains. How do we preserve cooked  food\nat home? Y ou know that br ead left\nunused under moist conditions is\nattacked by fungus. Microorganisms\nspoil our food.

W e\nhave to save it from the attack of\nmicroorganisms.\nChemical Method\nSalts and edible oils are the common\nchemicals generally used to check the\ngrowth of microorganisms. Therefore\nthey ar e called preservatives . We add\nsalt or acid preservatives to pickles to\nprevent the attack of microbes. Sodium\nbenzoate and sodium metabisulphite are\ncommon preservatives. These are also\nused in jams and squashes to check\ntheir spoilage .\nPreservation by Common Salt\nCommon salt has been used to preserve\nmeat and fish for ages. Meat and fish\nare covered with dry salt to check\nthe growth of bacteria. Salting is also\nused to preserve amla\n, raw mangoes,\ntamarind, etc.\nPreservation by Sugar\nJams, jellies and squashes are preserved\nby sugar . Sugar r educes the moistur e\ncontent which inhibits the growth of\nbacteria which spoil food.\nPreservation by Oil and Vinegar\nUse of oil and vinegar prevents spoilage\nof pickles because bacteria cannot live\nin such an envir onment. V egetables,\nfruits, fish and meat are often preserved\nby this method.\nHeat and Cold Treatments\nYou must have observed your mother\nboiling milk before it is stored or used.\nBoiling kills many microorganisms.Similarly, we keep our food in the\nrefrigerator . Low temperatur e inhibits\nthe growth of microbes.\nPasteurised milk can be consumed\nwithout boiling as it is free from harmful\nmicrobes. The milk is heated to about\n700C for 15 to 30 seconds and then\nsuddenly chilled and stored. By doing\nso, it prevents the growth of microbes.\nThis process was discovered by Louis\nPasteur . It is called pasteurisation .\nStorage and Packing\nThese days dry fruits and even\nvegetables are sold in sealed air tight\npackets to prevent the attack of\nmicrobes.\n2.6Nitrogen Fixation\nYou have lear nt about the bacterium\nRhizobium   in Classes VI and VII. It is\ninvolved in the  fixation of nitrogen in\nleguminous plants (pulses). Recall that\nRhizobium  lives in the root nodules of\nleguminous plants  (Fig. 2.9), such as\nbeans and peas, with which it has a\nsymbiotic relationship. Sometimes\nnitrogen gets fixed through the action\nof lightning. But you know that the\namount of nitrogen in the atmosphere\nremains constant. Y ou may wonder\nhow? Let us understand this in the next\nsection.\nWhy does the milk that\ncomes in packets not spoil?\nMy mother told me that the\nmilk is \u2018pasteurised\u2019. What\nis pasteurisation?\n2024-25\n\nMICROORGANISMS  : FRIEND AND FOE 27nitrogen cannot be taken directly by\nplants and animals. Certain bacteria and\nblue green algae  present in the soil fix\nnitrogen from the atmosphere and\nconvert it into compounds of nitrogen.\nOnce nitrogen is converted into these\nusable compounds, it can be utilised by\nplants from the soil through their root\nsystem. Nitrogen is then used for the\nsynthesis of plant proteins and other\ncompounds. Animals feeding on plants\nget these proteins and other nitrogen\ncompounds (Fig. 2.10).\nWhen plants and animals die,\nbacteria and fungi present in the soil\nconvert the nitrogenous wastes into\nnitrogenous compounds to be used by\nplants again. Certain other bacteria\nconvert some part of them to nitrogen\ngas which goes back into the\natmosphere. As a result, the percentage\nof nitrogen in the atmosphere remains\nmore or less constant.\nFig. 2.10  : Nitrogen cycle\nFig. 2.9 : Roots of a leguminous plant with root\nnodules\n2.7 Nitrogen cycle\nOur atmosphere has 78% nitrogen gas.\nNitrogen is one of the essential\nconstituents of all living organisms as\npart of proteins, chlorophyll, nucleic\nacids and vitamins.

W e shall\nalso discuss what steps we can take to\nminimise destruction caused by\nthese phenomena.\n12.1Lightning\nYou might have seen sparks on a\nelectric pole when wires become loose.\nThis phenomenon is quite common\nwhen wind is blowing and shaking the\nwires. You might also have seen sparks\nwhen a plug is loose in its socket.\nLightning is also an electric spark, but\non a huge scale.\nIn ancient times, people did not\nunderstand the cause of these sparks.\nThey were, therefore, afraid of lightning\nand thought that the wrath of gods was\nvisiting them. Now, of course, we\nunderstand that lightning is caused by\nthe accumulation of charges in the\nclouds. W e need not be afraid of\nlightning, but we have to take\nprecautions to protect ourselves from\nthe deadly sparks.\nThe Sparks that the Greeks Knew\nAbout\nThe ancient Greeks knew as early as\n600 B.C. that when amber (amber is akind of r esin) was rubbed with fur , it\nattracted light objects such as hair . You\nmight have seen that when you take\noff woollen or polyester clothes, your\nhair stands on end. If you take off these\nclothes in the dark, you even see a\nspark and hear a crackling sound. In\n1752 Benjamin Franklin, an American\nscientist, showed that lightning and the\nspark  from your clothes are essentially\nthe same phenomena. However , it took\n2000 years for this r ealisation to occur .\nWe shall now study some pr operties\nof electric char ges. W e shall also see how\nthey are related to the lightning in the\nsky.\nLet us per form some activities to\nunderstand the nature of electric\ncharges. But recall first what you might\nhave played as a game. When you rub\nI wonder why they took so\nmany years to realise the\nsimilarity.\nScientific discoveries are a\nresult of hardwork by many\npeople. It can sometimes take\na long time.\n2024-25\n\nSOME NATURAL  PHENOMENA 151\na plastic scale on your dry hair, the\nscale can attract very small pieces of\npaper.\n12.2 Charging by Rubbing\nActivity 12.1\nTake a used ballpen refill and rub\nit vigorously with a piece of\npolythene. Bring it close to small\npieces of paper. Take care not to\ntouch the rubbed end of the refill\nwith your hand or with a metallic\nobject. Repeat the activity withsmall pieces of dry leaf, husk and\nmustard seeds. Record your\nobservations.\nWhen a plastic refill is rubbed with\npolythene, it acquires a small electric\ncharge. Similarly, when a plastic comb\nis rubbed with dry hair, it acquires a\nsmall charge. These objects are called\ncharged objects . In the process of\ncharging the refill and the plastic comb,\npolythene and hair also get charged.\nLet\u2019s try to charge some other\nobjects  that are familiar to you.\nTable 12.1\nObjects Rubbed Materials Attracts/does not Charged/\nUsed for Rubbing Attract Pieces Not Charged\nof Paper\nRefill Polythene,\nwoollen cloth\nBalloon Polythene, woollen\ncloth, dry hair\nEraser Wool\nSteel spoon Polythene,\nwoollen clothActivity 12.2\nCollect the objects and the materials listed in Table 12.1. Try to charge each\nby rubbing with the materials mentioned in the Table. Record your findings.\nYou can add more items to the Table.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 15212.3 Types of Charges and\nTheir Interaction\nWe will select some objects fr om\nTable 12.1 for the next activity.\nActivity 12.3\n(a) Inflate two balloons. Hang them\nin such a way that they do not touch\neach other (Fig. 15.1). Rub both the\nballoons with a woollen cloth and\nrelease them. What do you observe?Rub the other refill also with\npolythene. Bring it close to the\ncharged refill. Be careful not to\ntouch the charged end with your\nhand. Is there any effect on the refill\nin the tumbler? Do the two attract\neach other , or repel each other?\nIn this activity we have brought\nclose together the charged objects\nthat were made of the same\nmaterial. What happens if two\ncharged objects made of different\nmaterials are brought close to each\nother? Let\u2019s find out.\n(b) Rub a refill and place it gently in\na glass tumbler as before\n(Fig. 12.3). Bring an inflated charged\nballoon near the refill and observe.\nFig. 12.1 : Like charges repel each other\nFig. 12.2 : Interaction between like chargesNow let us repeat this activity\nwith the used pen refills. Rub one\nrefill with polythene. Place it\ncarefully in a glass tumbler using\nthe tumbler as a stand (Fig. 12.2).\nFig. 12.3 : Unlike charges attract each other\nLet\u2019s summarise the observations:\nlA charged balloon repelled a charged\nballoon.\nlA charged refill repelled a charged\nrefill.\nlBut a charged balloon attracted a\ncharged refill.\nDoes it indicate that the charge on\nthe balloon is of a different kind from\nthe charge on the refill? Can we say\nthen, that there are two kinds of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2024-25\n\nSOME NATURAL  PHENOMENA 153charges? Can we also say that the\ncharges of the same kind repel each\nother , while char ges of dif ferent kind\nattract each other?\nIt is a convention to call  the charge\nacquired by a glass rod when it is\nrubbed with silk as positive.  The\nother kind of charge is said to be\nnegative.\nIt is observed that when a charged\nglass rod is brought near a charged\nplastic straw rubbed with polythene\nthere is attraction between the two.\nWhat do you think would be the kind\nof char ge on the plastic straw? Y our\nguess, that the plastic straw would carry\na negative charge is correct.\nThe electrical charges generated by\nrubbing are static. They do not move by\nthemselves. When charges move, they\nconstitute an electric current. Y ou have\nbeen reading about electric current since\nClass VI.  The current in a circuit which\nmakes a bulb glow, or the current that\nmakes a wire hot, is nothing but a\nmotion of charges.\n12.4 Transfer of Char ge\nActivity 12.4\nTake an empty jam bottle. Take a\npiece of cardboard slightly bigger in\nsize than the mouth of the bottle.\nPierce a hole in it so that a metal\npaper clip can be inserted. Open out\nthe paper clip as shown in Fig. 12.4.\nCut two strips of aluminium foil\nabout 4 cm \u00d7 1 cm each. Hang them\non the paper clip as shown. Insert\nthe paper clip in the cardboard lid\nso that it is perpendicular to it\n(Fig. 12.4). Charge a refill and touch\nFig 12.4 : A simple electroscopeit with the end of the paper clip.\nObserve what happens. Is there any\neffect on the foil strips? Do they\nrepel each other or attract each\nother? Now, touch other charged\nbodies with the end of the paper clip.\nDo foil strips behave in the same\nway in all cases? Can this apparatus\nbe used to detect whether a body is\ncharged or not? Can you explain\nwhy the foil strips repel each other?\nThe aluminium foil strips receive the\nsame charge from the charged refill\nthrough the paper clip (remember that\nmetals are good conductors of\nelectricity). The strips carrying similar\ncharges repel each other and they\nbecome wide open. Such a device can\nbe used to test whether an object is\ncarrying charge or not. This device is\nknown as electroscope .\nThus, we find that electrical charge\ncan be transferred from a charged object\nto another thr ough a metal conductor .\nTouch the end of the paper clip gently\nwith hand and you will find a change in\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 154the foil strips. They come back to their\noriginal state. Repeat charging of foil\nstrips and touching the paper clip. Every\ntime you will find that the foil strips\ncollapse as soon as you touch the\npaperclip  with hand . Why does it\nhappen? The reason is that the foil strips\nlose charge to the earth through your\nbody. W e say that the foil strips ar e\ndischarged . The process of transfe rring\nof charge from a charged object to the\nearth is called earthing .\nEarthing is provided in buildings to\nprotect us from electrical shocks due\nto any leakage of electrical current.\n12.5 The Story of Lightning\nIt is now possible to explain lightning\nin terms of the charges produced by\nrubbing.During the development of a\nthunderstorm, the air currents move\nupward while the water droplets move\ndownward. These vigorous movements\ncause separation of charges. By a\nprocess, not yet completely understood,\nthe positive charges collect near the\nupper edges of the clouds and the\nnegative charges accumulate near the\nlower edges. There is accumulation of\npositive charges near the ground also.\nWhen the magnitude of the\naccumulated charges becomes very\nlarge, the air which is normally a poor\nconductor of electricity, is no longer able\nto resist their flow. Negative and positive\ncharges meet, producing streaks of\nbright light and sound. W e see str eaks\nas lightning (Fig. 12.5). The process is\ncalled an electric discharge.\nFig. 12.5 : Accumulation of charges leading to lightning.\n2024-25\n\nSOME NATURAL  PHENOMENA 155\nThe process of electric discharge can\noccur between two or more clouds, or\nbetween clouds and the earth. Today we\nneed not get frightened by lightning like\nour ancestors did. Now we understand\nthe basic phenomenon. Scientists are\ntrying hard to improve this\nunderstanding. However , lightning\nstrike could destroy life and property. It\nis, therefore, necessary to take measures\nto protect ourselves.\n12.6 Lightning Safety\nDuring lightning and thunderstorm no\nopen place is safe.\nlHearing thunder is an alert to rush\nto a safer place.\nlAfter hearing the last thunder , wait\nfor some time before coming out of\nthe safe place.\nFinding a Safe Place\nA house or a building is a safe place.\nIf you are travelling by car or by bus,\nyou are safe inside with windows and\ndoors of the vehicle shut.\nDo\u2019s and Don\u2019ts during a\nThunderstorm\nOutside\nOpen vehicles, like motorbikes, tractors,\nconstruction machinery, open cars are\nnot safe. Open fields, tall trees, shelters\nin parks, elevated places do not protect\nus from lightning strokes.\nCarrying an umbrella is not at all a\ngood idea during thunderstorms.\nIf in a forest, take shelter under\nshorter trees.\nIf no shelter is available and you are\nin an open field, stay far away from all\ntrees. Stay away from poles or othermetal objects. Do not lie on the ground.\nInstead, squat low on the ground. Place\nyour hands on your knees with your\nhead between the hands (Fig. 12.6). This\nposition will make you the smallest\ntarget to be struck.\nInside the house\nLightning can strike telephone cords,\nelectrical wires and metal pipes (Do you\nremember , lightning is an electrical\ndischarge?). During a thunderstorm\ncontact with these should be avoided. It\nis safer to use mobile phones and\ncordless phones. However , it is not wise\nto call up a person who is receiving your\nphone through a wired phone.\nBathing should be avoided during\nthunderstorms to avoid contact with\nrunning water .\nElectrical appliances like computer s,\nTVs,\n etc., should be unplugged. Electrical\nlights can remain on . They  do not cause\nany harm.Fig. 12.6 : Safe position during lightning\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 156Lightning Conductors\nLightning Conductor is a device used\nto protect buildings from the effect of\nlightning. A metallic rod, taller than the\nbuilding, is installed in the walls of the\nbuilding during its construction. One\nend of the rod is kept out in the air and\nthe other is buried deep in the ground\n(Fig. 12.7). The rod provides easy route\nfor the transfer of electric charge to the\nground.\nThe metal columns used during\nconstruction, electrical wires and water\npipes in the buildings also protect us to\nan extent. But do not touch them during\na thunderstorm.12.7 Earthquakes\nYou just lear nt about thunderstor m and\nlightning. These natural phenomena can\ncause large scale destruction of human\nlife and property. Fortunately, these\nphenomena can be predicted to some\nextent.  The weather department can\nwarn about a thunderstorm developing\nin some area.\nIf a thunderstorm occurs there is\nalways a possibility of lightning and\ncyclones accompanying it.  So, we get\ntime to take measures to protect\nourselves from the damage caused by\nthese phenomena.\nFig. 12.7 :  Lightning conductorlightning\nconductor\ncopper\nplate\n2024-25\n\nSOME NATURAL  PHENOMENA 157Ther e is, however , one natural\nphenomenon which we are not yet able\nto predict accurately.  It is an\nearthquake.  It can cause damage to\nhuman life and property on a huge scale.\nA major earthquake occurred in\nIndia on 8 October 2005 in Uri and\nTangdhar towns of North Kashmir\n(Fig. 12.8). Before that a major\nearthquake occurred on 26 January\n2001 in Bhuj district of Gujarat.\nActivity 12.5\nAsk your parents about the huge\ndamage to life and property caused\nby these earthquakes.  Collect a few\npictures showing the damagecaused by these earthquakes from\nnewspapers and magazines of those\ndays.  Prepare a short report on the\nsuffering of the people during and\nafter the earthquakes.\nWhat is an earthquake? What\nhappens when it occurs?  What can we\ndo to minimise its effects?  These are\nsome of the questions which we shall\ndiscuss below.\nWhat is an Earthquake?\nAn earthquake is a sudden shaking or\ntrembling of the earth which lasts for a\nvery short time. It is caused by a\ndisturbance deep inside the earth\u2019s\nFig. 12.8 : Kashmir earthquake\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 158My grandmother told me\nthat the earth is balanced\non the horn of a bull and\nwhen the bull shifts it to\nthe other horn, an\nearthquake takes place.\nHow could it be true?\ncrust.  Earthquakes occur all the time,\nall over the earth.  They are not even\nnoticed.  Major earthquakes are much\nless frequent.  They can cause immense\ndamage to buildings, bridges, dams and\npeople.  There can be a great loss to life\nand property.  Earthquakes can cause\nfloods, landslides and tsunamis.  A\nmajor tsunami occurred in the Indian\nOcean on 26 December 2004.  All the\ncoastal areas around the ocean suffered\nhuge losses.\nActivity 12.6\nTake an outline map of the world.\nLocate the eastern coast and\nAndaman and Nicobar Islands in\nIndia.  Mark other countries around\nthe Indian Ocean which could have\nsuffered damage.  Collect accounts\nof the devastation caused by the\ntsunami in India from your parents,\nor other elders in the family or in\nthe neighbourhood.\nWhat Causes an Earthquake?\nFig. 12.10 : Earth platesWhat could cause a\ndisturbance inside\nthe earth?\nFig. 12.9 : Structure of the earthNow we know that the tremors are\ncaused by the disturbance deep down\ninside the uppermost layer of the earth\ncalled the crust  (Fig. 12.9).\nIn ancient times, people did not know\nthe true cause of earthquakes.  Their\nideas were, therefore, expressed in\nmythical stories such as the one told by\nBoojho\u2019s grandmother . Similar myths\nwere prevalent in other parts of\nthe world.The outermost layer of the earth is\nnot in one piece.  It is fragmented.  Each\nfragment is called a plate  (Fig. 12.10).\nThese plates are in continual motion.\nWhen they brush past one another ,\nArabian\nPlateEurasian\nPlate\nIndan\nPlate\ncrust\nmantle\nouter\ncore\ninner\ncore\n2024-25\n\nSOME NATURAL  PHENOMENA 159or a plate goes under another due to\ncollision (Fig. 12.11), they cause\ndisturbance in the earth\u2019s crust.  It is\nthis disturbance that shows up as an\nearthquake on the sur face of the earth.carried out.  However , most earthquakes\nare caused by the movement of earth\u2019s\nplates.\nSince earthquakes are caused by the\nmovement of plates, the boundaries of\nthe plates are the weak zones where\nearthquakes are mor e likely to occur .\nThe weak zones are also known as\nseismic  or fault zones .  In India, the\nareas most thr eatened ar e Kashmir ,\nWester n and Central Himalayas, the\nwhole of North-East, Rann of Kutch,\nRajasthan and the Indo\u2013Gangetic Plane.\nSome areas of South India also fall in\nthe danger zone  (Fig. 12.12).\nIf scientists know so much\nabout earthquakes, can\nthey also predict when and\nwhere the next one will\nstrike?\nI read somewhere that\nunderground explosions\ncould also cause\ntremors.\nFig. 12.11 : Movements of earth\u2019s plates\nFig. 12.12 : Movements of Indian earth\u2019s plate\nThe power of an earthquake is\nexpressed in terms of a magnitude\non a scale called the Richter scale .\nReally destructive earthquakes have\nmagnitudes higher than 7 on the\nRichter scale.  Both Bhuj and Kashmir\nearthquakes had magnitudes greater\nthan 7.5.Although, we know for sure what\ncauses an earthquake, it is not yet\npossible to predict when and where the\nnext earthquake might occur .\nTremors on the earth can also be\ncaused when a volcano erupts, or a\nmeteor hits the earth, or an\nunderground nuclear explosion is\nColliding\nBrushing\npast\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 160The tremors produce waves on the surface of the earth. These are called\nseismic waves. The waves are recorded by an instrument called the\nseismograph (Fig. 12.13). The instrument is simply a vibrating rod, or a\npendulum, which starts vibrating when tr emors occur . A pen is attached to\nthe vibrating system. The pen records the seismic waves on a paper which\nmoves under it. By studying these waves, scientists can construct a complete\nmap of the earthquake, as shown in  Fig. 12.14. They can also estimate its\npower to cause destruction.\nFig. 12.13 : A seismographA typical seismograph record\nFig. 12.14 : Map of the earthquake\nEpicentreSeismic\nwavesFocus\nInside the earthEarth\u2019s\nSurface\nLike many other scales in science (decibel is another example), Richter scale\nis not linear .  This means that an earthquake of magnitude 6 does not have\none and half times the destructive energy of an earthquake of magnitude 4.\nIn fact, an increase of 2 in magnitude means 1000 times more destructive\nenergy. Therefore, an earthquake of magnitude 6 has thousand times more\ndestructive energy than an earthquake of magnitude 4.\nProtection against Earthquakes\nWe know fr om the earlier pages that\nearthquakes cannot be pr edicted.  W e\nhave also seen that they can be highly\ndestructive.  It is, therefore, important\nthat we take necessary precautions to\nprotect ourselves all the time.  Peopleliving in seismic zones, where the\nearthquakes are mor e likely to occur ,\nhave to be specially prepared.  First of\nall, the buildings in these zones should\nbe so designed that they can withstand\nmajor tremors. Modern building\ntechnology can make it possible.\nString\nPenPendulum Bob\nRotating\nDrum\nChart\nPaperSupport\n2024-25\n\nSOME NATURAL  PHENOMENA 161It is advisable to make the structure\nsimple so that it is \u2018Quake Safe\u2019.\nlConsult qualified architects and\nstructural engineers.\nlIn highly seismic areas, the use of\nmud or timber is better than using\nheavy construction material.

This principle marks a\ndeparture from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system\nand causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and\ntextbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic\nidea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\nboundaries between dif ferent subject ar eas. W e hope these measur es will take us\nsignificantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined\nin the National Policy on Education (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and\nteachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to\npursue imaginative activities and questions. W e must r ecognise that, given space,\ntime and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the\ninformation passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the\nsole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites\nof learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we\nperceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed\nbody of knowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change i n school routines and mode of\nfunctioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in\nimplementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days\nare actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation\nwill also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children\u2019s life at\nschool a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus\ndesigners have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring\nand reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child\npsychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance\nthis endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for\ncontemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups and activities requiring\nhands-on experience.\nThe National Council of Educational Resear ch and T raining (NCER T) appr eciates\nthe hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this\nbook. W e wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory gr oup in science and\nmathematics, Pr ofessor J.V . Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book,\nProfessor V .B. Bhatia for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers\ncontributed to the development of this textbook. W e are grateful to their principals\nfor making this possible. W e are indebted to the institutions and or ganisations\nwhich have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and\npersonnel. W e are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring\nCommittee, appointed by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education,Foreword\n2024-25\n\nMinistry of Human Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of\nProfessor Mrinal Miri and Pr ofessor G.P . Deshpande, for their valuable time\nand contribution.\nAs an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous\nimprovement in the quality of its pr oducts, NCER T welcomes comments\nand suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision and\nrefinement.\nDirector\nNew Delhi National Council of Educational\n30 November 2007 Research and Trainingiv\n2024-25\n\nRationalisation of Content\nin the Textbooks\nIn view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load\non students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing\nthe content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with\ncreative mindset. In this backgr ound, the NCER T has undertaken the\nexercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes\nalready developed by the NCER T acr oss classes have been taken into\nconsideration in this exercise.\nContents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the\nfollowing:\n\u2022Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in\nthe same class\n\u2022Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same\nsubject\n\u2022Difficulty level\n\u2022Content, which is easily accessible to students without much\ninterventions from teachers and can be learned by children through\nself-lear ning or peer -learning\n\u2022Content, which is irrelevant in the present context\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the\nchanges given above.\n2024-25\n\n2024-25\n\nThis book is the outcome of the efforts of the textbook development committee\nappointed by the NCER T. The committee met a few times to interact with one\nanother to improve the draft. Then there was a review meeting in which many\nexperts and practicing school teachers were invited to review the draft and suggest\nimprovements.\nBy and large we have stuck to the format of the Class VII book. By now famous\ncharacters, Boojho and Paheli, have been used to make the text interactive. Attempt\nhas been made to recall children\u2019s own experiences and build concepts around\nthem. This is designed to connect science that they study in the school with their\neveryday life.\nMany activities have been suggested to clarify concepts. Some of these activities\nare so simple that children can perform them on their own. The requirement of the\napparatus r equir\ned for the activities is minimal. W e per formed all the activities\nourselves to ensure that there was no difficulty in performing them in the school\nsituation. The activities should also help children in developing skills such as\npresentation of data in tabular and graphical forms, reasoning and drawing inference\nfrom the given data.\nThe language of the book has been kept as simple as possible. A large number of\nphotographs, illustrations, cartoons, etc. have been included to make the book\nattractive. To help teachers evaluate children effectively, a large number of exercises\nhave been given at the end of each chapter . The teachers are encouraged to frame\nadditional exercises to test children\u2019s understanding. Some challenging exercises\nhave also been devised for those children who would like to appear for the National\nTalent Sear ch Examination conducted by the NCER T.\nWe are conscious of the fact that ther e is a paucity of additional r eading material\nfor children. W e have tried to addr ess this pr oblem by pr oviding non-evaluative\nboxes . These boxes, in light orange, contain additional information, anecdotes,\nstories, strange facts and other such interesting materials.\nWe all know that children ar e mischievous and playful by natur e. Ther efore, in\norder to prevent any untoward incident during the performance of the activities in\nthe school or outside, necessary cautions, in magenta, have been inserted at various\nplaces in the book.\nTo prepare children to assume their roles as responsible citizens of tomorrow,\nattempt has been made to sensitise them to the issues concer ning gender , religion,\nenvir onment, health and hygiene, water scar city and ener gy conservation. W e have\nsought to weave into the text the value of cooperation and the importance of peer\nlearning.\nAn important feature of the book is what we call Extended Learning . These are\ntotally non-evaluative , and purely voluntary activities and projects. Some of the\nprojects in this section have been designed to enhance children\u2019s interaction with\nthe experts, teachers, even parents, and society at large. The children are required\nto collect information of various kinds and draw conclusions of their own.\nMy request to teachers and parents is to use the book in the spirit in which it\nhas been written. Encourage children to perform activities and learn by doing, rather\nthan by r ote. Y ou can supplement, or even r eplace, the activities given her e. If youPreface\n2024-25\n\nfeel that you have better alter natives, especially with your local/r egional flavour ,\nplease write to us so that these activities could be used in the future editions of\nthe book.\nWe have been able to include only a small subset of childr en\u2019s experiences. Y ou\nhave a better knowledge of their experiences because you are in touch with them.\nUse them to illustrate the concepts being taught. Above all, please do not stifle\nchildren\u2019s natural curiosity. Encourage them to ask questions, even if sometimes\nyou feel uncomfortable. If you do not know the answer to a question on the spot, do\nnot feel embarrassed. Y ou can pr omise them to find the answer and deal with it\nlater. Make a genuine attempt to get the answer fr om whatever r esour ces ar e within\nyour reach, such as senior school or college teachers, experts, libraries, internet\netc. If, inspite of your efforts, you cannot get the answer to some question, you could\nwrite to NCER T.\nI must thank the NCER T for enabling us to talk to childr en thr ough the medium\nof this book. Every member of the NCER T has been courteous and helpful to us.\nIn the end, I must express my gratitude to the members of the Editing Team,\nwho worked tirelessly to help me bring the book to the present form. If you and your\nstudents find this book useful and enjoy teaching/learning science through this\nbook, the Editing Team and I shall consider ourselves well-rewarded.\nV.B.

They love to ask questions. All kinds of questions come to their\nminds and they collect them in their sacks. Sometimes, they may share some\nof the questions with you, as you read through the chapters.\nPaheli and Boojho are also on the lookout for answers to many\nquestions \u2014 sometimes the questions seem answered after they discuss them\nwith each other , sometimes thr ough discussions with other classmates, teachers\nor their parents. Answers to some questions do not seem available even after\nall these. They might need to experiment on their own, read books in the library,\nsend questions to scientists. Just dig and dig and dig into all possibilities and\nsee if the questions can be answered. Perhaps, they would carry some of the\nunanswered questions in their sacks to higher classes.\nWhat will really thrill them would be your adding questions to their sacks\nor answers to their questions. Sometimes, activities are suggested in the\ntextbook, results or findings of these by different groups of students would be\nof inter est to other students and teachers. Y ou can complete the suggested\nactivities and send your results or findings to Paheli and Boojho. Do keep in\nmind that activities that involve using blades, scissors or fire need to be done\nstrictly under the care of your teachers. Stick to the precautions given and\nthen enjoy doing all the suggested activities. Mind, the book will not be able to\nhelp you much, if the activities are not completed!\nWe would like to advise you that you must make observations yourself\nand record whatever results you get. Keen and true observations are necessary\nfor exploring any subject of study. For some reason your results may turn out\nto be dif ferent fr om those of your classmates. Do not worry. T ry to find out the\nreason for these results instead of disregarding them.

Y ou, too,\nslow down your bicycle whenever\nneeded by applying brakes. Have you\never thought why a vehicle slows\ndown when brakes are applied? Not\nonly vehicles, any object, moving over\nthe sur face of another object slows\ndown when no external force is\napplied on it. Finally it stops. Have\nyou not seen a moving ball on the\nground stopping after some time?\nWhy do we slip when we step on a\nbanana peel (Fig. 9.1)? Why is it\ndifficult to walk on a smooth and\nwet floor?\nFig. 9.1 : A boy falls down when he steps on a\nbanana peel9.1 Force of Friction\nActivity 9.1\nGently push a book on a table\n[Fig. 9.2(a)]. Y ou observe that it stops\nafter moving for some distance.\nRepeat this activity pushing the\nbook from the opposite direction\n[Fig. 9.2, (b)]. Does the book stop\nthis time, too? Can you think of an\nexplanation? Can we say that a force\nmust be acting on the book\nopposing its motion? This force is\ncalled the force of friction.\nFig. 9.2 (a), (b) : Friction opposes relative\nmotion between the\nsurfaces of the book and\nthe table(a)\n(b)\nYou will find the answers to such\nquestions in this chapter .\n2024-25\n\nYou saw that if you apply the for ce\nalong the left, friction acts along the\nright. If you apply the force along the\nright, the friction acts along the left\ndirection. In both cases the force opposes\nthe motion of the book. The force of\nfriction always opposes the applied force.\nIn the above activity, the force of\nfriction acts between the sur face of the\nbook and the sur face of the table.\nIs the  friction the same for all the\nsurfaces? Does it depend on the\nsmoothness of the surfaces? Let us find\nout.\n9.2 Factors affecting Friction\nActivity 9.2\nTie a string ar ound a brick. Pull the\nbrick by a spring balance (Fig. 9.3).\nYou need to apply some for ce. Note\ndown the readi ng on the spring\nbalance when the brick just\nbegins to move. It gives you a\nmeasure of the force of friction\nbetween the sur face of the brick\nand the floor .for this difference? Repeat this\nactivity by wrapping a piece of jute\nbag around the brick. What do you\nobserve?\nFig. 9.3 : A brick is being pulled by spring\nbalance\nNow wrap a piece of polythene\naround the brick and repeat the\nactivity. Do you observe any\ndifference in the readings of the\nspring balance in the above two\ncases? What might be the reasonSpring Balance\nSpring balance is a device used for\nmeasuring the force acting on an\nobject. It consists of a coiled spring\nwhich gets stretched when a force is\napplied to it. Stretching of the spring\nis measured by a pointer moving on\na graduated scale. The reading on the\nscale gives the magnitude of the force.\nActivity 9.3\nMake an inclined plane on a smooth\nfloor, or on a table. Y ou may use a\nwooden board supported by bricks,\nor books. [Fig. 9.4 (a)]. Put a mark\nwith a pen at any point A on the\ninclined plane. Now let  a pencil cell\nmove down from this point. How far\ndoes it move on the table before\ncoming to rest? Note down the\ndistance. Now spread a piece of cloth\nFRICTION 113\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 114\nFig. 9.5 : Surface irregularitiesover the table. Make sure that there\nare no wrinkles in the cloth. T ry the\nactivity again [Fig. 9.4 (b)].Does the distance covered depend on\nthe natur e of the sur face on which the\ncell moves?\nCould the smoothness of the sur face\nof the cell also affect the distance\ntravelled by it?\n(a)\n(b)\nRepeat this activity by spreading\na thin layer of sand over the\ntable. Maintain the same slope\nthroughout the activity.\nIn which case is the distance covered\nthe minimum? Why is the distance\ncovered by the pencil cell different every\ntime. T ry to r eason why? Discuss the\nresult.Fig. 9.4 : The pencil cell covers different\ndistances on different surfacesI shall try the activity\nby wrapping a piece of\nsandpaper around\nthe cell.\nFriction is caused by the\nirregularities on the two sur faces in\ncontact. Even those sur faces which\nappear very smooth have a large number\nof minute irregularities on them\n(Fig. 9.5). Irregularities on the two\nsurfaces lock into one another . When\nwe attempt to move any sur face, we have\nto apply a force to overcome interlocking.\nOn rough sur faces, ther e are a lar ger\nnumber of irregularities. So the force of\nfriction is gr eater if a r ough sur face\nis involved.Mark A\nMark A\nSurface of book\nSurface of table\n2024-25\n\nFRICTION 115\nWe see that the friction is caused by\nthe interlocking of irregularities in the\ntwo sur faces. It is obvious that the for ce\nof friction will increase if the two\nsurfaces ar e pressed har der. You can\nexperience it by dragging a mat when\nnobody is sitting on it, and when a\npreson is sitting on it.friction and you find it somewhat easier\nto move the box already in motion than\nto get it started.\n9.3 Friction : A Necessary\nEvil\nRecall now some of your experiences. Is\nit easier to hold a kulhar\n (earthen pot)\nor a glass tumbler? Suppose the outer\nsurface of the tumbler is greasy, or has\na thin layer of cooking oil on it; would it\nbecome easier or more difficult to hold\nit? Just think : would it be possible to\nhold the glass at all if there is no\nfriction?\nRecall also how difficult it is to move\non a wet muddy track, or wet marble\nfloor. Can you imagine being able to walk\nat all if there were no friction?\nYou could not write with pen or\npencil if there were no friction.  When\nyour teacher is writing with chalk on\nthe blackboard, its r ough sur face rubs\noff some chalk particles which stick to Recall your experience when last time\nyou moved a heavy box from one place\nto another (Fig. 9.6). If you have no such\nexperience, get that experience now.\nWhat is easier \u2014 to move the box from\nrest, or to move it when it is already in\nmotion?\nThe force required to overcome\nfriction at the instant an object starts\nmoving from rest is a measure of static\nfriction. On the other hand, the force\nrequired to keep the object moving with\nthe same speed is a measure of sliding\nfriction.\nWhen the box starts sliding, the\ncontact points on its sur face, do not get\nenough time to lock into the contact\npoints on the floor . So, the sliding\nfriction is slightly smaller than the staticFig. 9.7 : A nail is fixed in the wall due to\nfriction\nFig. 9.6 : You have to push on the box to keep it\nmoving\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 116\nthe black board. Could it happen if there\nwere no friction between the chalk and\nthe board?\nIf an object started moving, it would\nnever stop if there were no friction. Had\nthere been no friction between the tyres\nof the automobiles and the road, they\ncould not be started or stopped or\nturned to change the direction of\nmotion. Y ou could not fix a nail on the\nwall (Fig. 9.7) or tie a knot. Without\nfriction no building could be constructed.\nFig.  9.8 : Soles of shoes wear out due\nto friction\nFig.  9.10 : Stricking a matchstick produces fire\nby friction\nproduces heat. In fact, when a machine\nis operated, heat generated causes much\nwastage of energy. W e shall discuss the\nways of minimising friction in the\nfollowing section.\nFig.  9.9 : Rubbing of your palms makes you\nfeel warm\nOn the other hand, friction is an evil,\ntoo. It wears out the materials whether\nthey are screws, ball bearings or soles\nof shoes (Fig. 9.8). Y ou must have seen\nworn-out steps of foot over -bridges at\nrailway stations.\nFriction can also produce heat.\nVigorously rub your palms together for\na few minutes (Fig. 9.9). How do you\nfeel? When you strike a matchstick\nagainst the r ough sur face, it catches fir e\n(Fig. 9.10).\nYou might have observed that the jar\nof a mixer becomes hot when it is runfor a few minutes. Y ou can cite various\nother examples in which friction\n2024-25\n\nFRICTION 117\n9.4 Increasing and Reducing\nFriction\nAs you have seen in the previous section,\nfriction is desirable in some situations.\nHave you ever thought why the sole\nof your shoe is grooved [Fig. 9.11 (a)]? It\nis done to provide the shoes better grip\non the floor , so that you can move safely.\nSimilarly, the treaded tyres of cars,trucks\nand bulldozers provide better grip with\nthe ground.In some situations, however , friction\nis undesirable and we would want to\nminimise it.\nWhy do you sprinkle fine powder on\nthe carr om boar d (Fig. 9.12)? Y ou might\nhave noticed that when a few drops of\noil ar e pour ed on the hinges of a door,\nthe door moves smoothly. A bicycle and\na motor mechanic uses grease between\nthe moving parts of these machines. In\nall the above cases, we want to reduce\nFig. 9.12 : Powder is sprinkled on the carrom\nboard to reduce friction\nfriction in order to increase efficiency.\nWhen oil, grease or graphite is applied\nbetween the moving part of a machine,\na thin layer is formed there and moving\nsurfaces do not dir ectly rub against each\nother (Fig. 9.13). Interlocking of\nirregularities is avoided to a great extent.\nMovement becomes smooth. The\nsubstances which reduce friction are\ncalled lubricants . In some machines, it\nmay not be advisable to use oil as\nlubricant. An air cushion between the\nmoving parts is used to reduce friction.We deliberately incr ease friction by\nusing brake pads in the brake system\nof bicycles and automobiles. When you\nare riding a bicycle, the brake pads do\nnot touch the wheels. But when you\npress the brake lever , these pads arr est\nthe motion of  the rim due to friction.\nThe wheel stops moving. Y\nou might have\nseen that kabaddi  players rub their\nhands with soil for a better grip of their\nopponents. Gymnasts apply some coarse\nsubstance on their hands to increase\nfriction for better grip.(a) (b)\nFig. 9.11 : (a) Soles of shoes and (b) tyres are\ntreaded to increase friction\nFig. 9.13 : Action of lubricantSurface 1Surface 2\nLubricant\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 118\nActivity 9.4\nTake a few pencils which are\ncylindrical in shape. Place them\nparallel to each other on a table.\nPlace a thick book over it\n(Fig. 9.15). Now push the book. Y ou\nobserve the pencils rolling as the\nbook moves. Do you feel it easier to\nmove the book in this way than to\nslide it? Do you think that\nresistance to the motion of the book\nhas been reduced? Have you seen\nheavy machinary being moved by\nplacing logs under it?\n9.5 Wheels Reduce Friction\nYou must have seen attaches and other\npieces of luggage fitted with rollers. Even\na child can pull such pieces of luggage\n(Fig. 9.14). Why is it so? Let us\nfind out.Can we reduce friction to\nzero by polishing surfaces\nor using large amount of\nlubricants?\nFriction can never be\nentirely eleminated. No\nsurface is perfectly smooth.\nSome irregularities are\nalways there.\nFig. 9.15 : Motion of the book on rollers\nWhen one body r olls over the sur face\nof another body, the resistance to its\nmotion is called rolling friction . Rolling\nreduces friction. It is always easier to\nroll than to slide a body over another .\nThat is the reason it is convenient to\npull luggage fitted with rollers. Can you\nnow understand why the wheel is said\nto be one of the greatest inventions of\nmankind?\nSince the rolling friction is smaller\nthan the sliding friction , sliding is\nreplaced in most machines by rolling\nby the use of ball bearings. Common\nexamples are the use of ball bearings\nbetween hubs and the axles of ceiling\nfans and bicycles (Fig. 9.16). Fig. 9.14 : Rolling reduces friction\n2024-25\n\nFRICTION 119\n9.6 Fluid Friction\nYou know that air is very light and thin.\nYet it exerts frictional force on objects\nmoving through it. Similarly, water and\nother liquids exert force of friction when\nobjects move through them. In science,\nthe common name of gases and liquidsis fluids\n. So we can say that fluids exert\nforce of friction on objects in motion\nthrough them.\nThe frictional force exerted by fluids\nis also called drag.\nThe frictional force on an object in a\nfluid depends on its speed with respect\nto the fluid. The frictional force also\ndepends on the shape of the object and\nthe nature of the fluid.\nIt is obvious that when objects\nmove through fluids, they have to\novercome friction acting on them. In\nthis process they lose energy. Efforts\nare, therefore, made to minimise\nfriction. So, objects are given special\nshapes. Where do you think scientists\nget hints for these special shapes?\nFrom nature, of course. Birds and\nfishes have to move about in fluids\nall the time. Their bodies must have\nevolved to shapes which would make\nthem lose less energy in overcoming\nfriction. Look carefully at the shape\nof an aeroplane (Fig. 9.17). Do you\nfind any similarity in its shape and\nthat of a bird? In fact, all vehicles are\ndesigned to have shapes which reduce\nfluid friction.\nFig. 9.17 :  Similarity in shapes of an aeroplane and a bird\nFig. 9.16 : Ball bearings reduce friction\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 120\n KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS\nBALL BEARING\nDRAG\nFLUID FRICTION\nFRICTION\nINTERLOCKING\nLUBRICANTS\nROLLING FRICTION\nSLIDING FRICTION\nSTATIC FRICTION WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\n\u00dcFriction opposes the relative motion between\ntwo surfaces in contact.

            "text": "CHEMICAL  EFFECTS  OF\nELECTRIC  CURRENTCHEMICAL  EFFECTS  OF\nELECTRIC  CURRENT\nYour elders might have cautioned\nyou against touching an electrical\nappliance with wet hands. But\ndo you know why it is dangerous to\ntouch an electrical appliance with wet\nhands?\nWe have lear nt earlier that the\nmaterials, which allow electric current\nto pass through them, are good\nconductors of electricity. On the other\nhand, materials, which do not allow\nelectric current to pass through them\neasily, are poor conductors of electricity.\nIn Class VI, we made a tester  to test\nwhether a particular material allows the\nelectric current to pass through it or not.\nDo you recall how the tester helped us\nin deciding that?\nWe found that metals such as copper\nand aluminium conduct electricity\nwher eas materials such as rubber ,plastic and wood do not conduct\nelectricity. However , so far we have used\nour tester to test materials which were\nin solid state. But what about liquids?\nDo liquids also conduct electricity? Let\nus find out.\nPaheli and Boojho want to\nremind you that one\nshould not experiment\nwith the electric supply\nfrom the mains or a\ngenerator or an inverter .\nUse only electric cells for\nall the activities suggested\nhere.\nFig.11.1 :  A tester11.1 Do Liquids Conduct\nElectricity?\nTo test whether a liquid allows electric\ncurrent to pass through it or not, we\ncan use the same tester (Fig .11.1).\n2024-25\n\nHowever , replace the cell by a battery.\nAlso, before using the tester we\nshould check whether it is working\nor not.\nActivity 11.1\nJoin the free ends of the tester\ntogether for a moment. This\ncompletes the circuit of the tester\nand the bulb should glow.  However ,\nif the bulb does not glow, it means\nthat the tester is not working. Can\nyou think of the possible reasons?\nIs it possible that the connections\nare loose? Or , the bulb is fused? Or ,\nyour cells are used up? Check that\nall the connections are tight. If they\nare, then replace the bulb with\nanother bulb. Now test if the tester\nis working or not. If it is still not\nworking then replace the cells with\nfresh cells.\nNow that our tester is working, let\nus use it to test the various liquids.\n(Caution: While checking your tester ,\ndo not join its free ends for more than a\nfew seconds. Otherwise the cells of the\nbattery will drain very quickly.)\nActivity 11.2\nCollect a few small plastic or rubber\ncaps of discarded bottles and clean\nthem. Pour one teaspoon of lemon\njuice or vinegar in one cap. Bring\nyour tester over this cap and let the\nends of the tester dip into lemon juice\nor vinegar as shown in Fig. 11.2. Take\ncare that the ends are not more than\n1 cm apart but at the same time do\nnot touch each other . Does the bulbFig. 11.2 :  Testing conduction of electricity in\nlemon juice or vinegarof the tester glow? Does lemon juice\nor vinegar conduct electricity? How\nwould you classify lemon juice or\nvinegar \u2014 a good conductor or a poor\nconductor?\nWhen the liquid between the two\nends of the tester allows the electric\ncurrent to pass, the circuit of the tester\nbecomes complete. The current flows in\nthe circuit and the bulb glows. When\nthe liquid does not allow the electric\ncurrent to pass, the circuit of the tester\nis not complete and the bulb does not\nglow.\nIn some situations even though the\nliquid is conducting, the bulb may not\nglow . It may have happened in\nActivity 11.2 . What can be the reason?\nDo you remember why the bulb\nglows when the electric current passes\nthrough it? Due to the heating effect\nof current, the filament of the bulb gets\nheated to a high temperature and it\nstarts glowing. However , if the current\nthrough a circuit is too weak, the\nfilament does not get heated\nCHEMICAL  EFFECTS  OF ELECTRIC  CURRENT 139\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 140Activity 11.3\nTake the tray from inside a discarded\nmatchbox. W rap an electric wir e a few\ntimes around the tray. Place a small\ncompass needle inside it. Now\nconnect one free end of the wire to\nthe terminal of a battery. Leave the\nother end free. Take another piece of\nwire and connect it to the other\nterminal of the battery (Fig. 11\n.4).\nFig 11.4 :  Another testersufficiently and it does not glow. And\nwhy is the current in the circuit weak?\nWell, though a material may conduct\nelectricity, it may not conduct it as\neasily as a metal. As a result, the\ncircuit of the tester may be complete\nand yet the current through it may be\ntoo weak to make the bulb glow. Can\nwe make another tester which can\ndetect a weak current?\nWe can use another ef fect of an electric\ncurrent to make another kind of tester .\nDo you recall that electric current\nproduces a magnetic effect? What\nhappens to a compass needle kept nearby\nwhen current flows in a wire? Even if\nthe current is small, the deflection of the\nmagnetic needle can be seen. Can we\nmake a tester using the magnetic\neffect of currents? Let us find out  in\nActivity 11.3 .\nJoin the free ends of two wires\nmomentarily. The compass needle\nshould show deflection\n. Your tester\nwith two free ends of the wire is ready.\nNow repeat Activity 11.2 using this\ntester . Do you find a deflection in the\ncompass needle the moment you dip\nthe free ends of the tester in lemon\njuice?\nTake out the ends of the tester\nfrom the lemon juice, dip them in\nwater and then wipe them dry.\nRepeat the activity with other liquids\nsuch as tap water , vegetable oil, milk,\nhoney. (Remember to wash and wipe\ndry the ends of tester after testing\neach liquid).  In each case observe\nwhether the magnetic needle shows\ndeflection or not. Record your\nobservations in Table 11.1.\nYou may use an LED (Fig. 11.3) in\nplace of the electric bulb in the tester\nof Fig. 11.2. LED glows even when a\nweak electric current flows through\nit.\nThere are two wires (called leads)\nattached to an LED. One lead is\nslightly longer than the other .\nRemember that while connecting to\na circuit, the longer lead is always\nconnected to the positive terminal of\nthe battery and the shorter lead is\nconnected to the negative terminal of\nthe battery.\nFig. 11.3 : LEDs\n2024-25\n\nCHEMICAL  EFFECTS  OF ELECTRIC  CURRENT 141\nTable 11.1 : Good/Poor Conducting Liquids\nS.No. Material Compass Needle Shows Good Conductor/\nDeflection Y es/No Poor Conductor\n1.

But she has also read\nthat during lightning, an electric\ncurrent passes thr ough air . She\nwonders if air is indeed a poor\nconductor under all conditions.\nThis makes Boojho ask whether\nother materials classified as\npoor conductors also allow\nelectricity to pass under\ncertain conditions.\nFrom Table 11.1, we find that some\nliquids are good conductors of electricity\nand some are poor conductors.\nActually, under certain conditions\nmost materials can conduct. That is why\nit is preferable to classify materials as\ngood conductors and poor conductors\ninstead of classifying as conductors and\ninsulators.We have tested the conduction of\nelectricity thr ough tap water . Let us now\ntest the conduction of electricity through\ndistilled water .\nActivity 11.4\nTake about two teaspoonfuls of\ndistilled water in a clean and dry\nplastic or rubber cap of a bottle. (You\nmay obtain distilled water from your\nschool science lab. Y ou may also get\ndistilled water from a medical store\nor a doctor or a nurse) . Use the tester\nto test whether distilled water\nconducts electricity or not. What do\nyou find? Does distilled water\nconduct electricity? Now dissolve a\npinch of common salt in distilled\nwater .

This is a\nconductor of electricity.\nThe water that we get from sources\nsuch as taps, hand pumps, wells and\nponds is not pure. It may contain\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 142several salts dissolved in it. Small\namounts of mineral salts are naturally\npresent in it. This water is thus a good\nconductor of electricity. On the other\nhand, distilled water is free of salts and\nis a poor conductor.Most liquids that conduct electricity\nare solutions of acids, bases and salts.\nWhen an electric current flows\nthrough a conducting solution, does it\nproduce an effect on the solution?\n11.2 Chemical Effects of\nElectric Current\nIn Class VII, we have learnt some effects\nof electric current. Can you list these\neffects? What effect does the current\nproduce when it flows through a\nconducting solution? Let us find out.\nActivity 11.6\nTake out carbon rods carefully from\ntwo discarded cells. Clean their\nmetal caps with sand paper . Wrap\ncopper  wires around the metal caps\nof the carbon rods  and join them to\na battery (Fig. 1 1.5). W e call these\ntwo rods electrodes . (Instead ofSmall amounts of mineral salts\npresent naturally in water are\nbeneficial for human health.\nHowever , these salts make water\na good conductor . So, we should\nnever handle electrical\nappliances with wet hands or\nwhile standing on a wet floor .\nWe have found that common salt,\nwhen dissolved in distilled water , makes\nit a good conductor . What are the other\nsubstances which, when dissolved in\ndistilled water , make it conducting? Let\nus find out.\nCaution: Do the next activity under the\nsupervision of your teacher/parent or\nsome elderly person, because the use of\nacid is involved in it.\nActivity 11.5\nTake three clean plastic or rubber caps\nof bottles. Pour about two teaspoonfuls\nof distilled water in each of them. Add\na few drops of lemon juice or dilute\nhydrochloric acid to distilled water in\none cap. Now in the second cap\ncontaining distilled water , add a few\ndrops of a base such as caustic soda\nor potassium iodide. Add a little sugar\nto the distilled water in the third cap\nand dissolve it.

He cut\na potato into two halves and\ninserted the copper wires of a tester\ninto it. Just then his mother called\nhim and he forgot to take out the\nwires of the tester inserted into the\npotato. When he came back after\nhalf an hour , he noticed that ther e\nwas a greenish blue spot on the\npotato around one wire whereas\nthere was no such spot around the\nother wire (Fig. 11.6).carbon rods, you may take two iron\nnails about 6 cm lon g.) Pour a\ncupful of water in a glass/plastic\nbowl. Add a teaspoonful of salt or a\nfew drops of lemon juice to water to\nmake it more conducting.  Now\nimmerse the electrodes in this\nsolution. Make sure that the metal\ncaps of the carbon rods are outside\nthe water . Wait for 3-4 minute s.\nObserve the electrodes carefully. Do\nyou notice any gas bubbles near the\nelectrodes? Can we  call the change\ntaking place in the solution a\nchemical change? Recall the\ndefinition of a chemical change that\nyou learnt in Class VII.\nIn 1800, a British chemist, William\nNicholson (1753\u20131815), had shown\nthat if electrodes\nwere immersed\nin water , and a\ncurrent was passed,\nbubbles of oxygen\nand hydrogen were\nproduced. Oxygen\nbubbles formed\non the electrode\nconnected to the positive terminal of\nthe battery and hydrogen bubbles\nformed on the other electrode.\nThe passage of an electric current\nthrough a conducting solution causes\nchemical reactions. As a result, bubbles\nof a gas may be formed on the electrodes.\nDeposits of metal may be seen on\nelectrodes. Changes of colour of\nsolutions may occur . The reaction would\ndepend on what solution and electrodes\nare used. These are some of the chemical\neffects of the electric current.\nFig. 11.6 :  Testing potato\nHe was surprised with this\nobservation and along with Paheli\nrepeated this activity many times. They\nfound that it was always the wire\nconnected to the positive terminal,\nwhich had a greenish blue spot around\nit. They felt that this discovery was very\nuseful because it could be used for\nidentifying the positive terminal of a\ncell or a battery  concealed in a box.\nThey decided to report their finding to\na children\u2019s magazine.\nRemember that Boojho set out to\ntest whether potato conducted\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 144Allow the current to pass for\nabout 15 minutes. Now remove the\nelectrodes from the solution and\nlook at them carefully. Do you find\nany difference in any one of them?\nDo you find a coating over it? What\ncolour is the coating ? Note down \nthe\nterminal of the battery with which\nthis electrode is connected.electricity or not. What he found was\nthat current produced a chemical\neffect in the potato. To him this was\nvery exciting. In fact, this is how\nscience sometimes works. Y ou ar e\nlooking for something and you\ndiscover something else. Many\nimportant discoveries have been\nmade in this manner .\n11.3 Electroplating\nYou know  that a brand new bicycle has\nshiny handlebar and wheel rims.\nHowever , if these ar e accidentally\nscratched, the shiny coating comes off\nrevealing a not so shiny sur face beneath.\nYou might have also seen women using\nornaments, which appear  to be made of\ngold. However , with r epeated use, the\ngold coating wears off, revealing silver or\nsome other metal beneath.\nIn both these cases, a metal has a\ncoating of another metal. Do you wonder\nhow a layer of one metal can be\ndeposited on top of another? W ell, let\nus try doing it ourselves.\nActivity 11.7\nWe will need copper sulphate and\ntwo copper plates of size around\n10 cm \u00d7 4 cm. T ake 250 mL of\ndistilled water in a clean and dry\nbeaker . Dissolve two teaspoonfuls of\ncopper sulphate in it. Add a few drops\nof dilute sulphuric acid to copper\nsulphate solution to make it more\nconducting. Clean copper plates with\nsand paper . Now rinse them with\nwater and dry them.  Connect the\ncopper plate s to the terminals of a\nbattery \nand immerse them in copper\nsulphate solution (Fig. 11.7).When electric current is passed\nthrough the copper sulphate solution,\ncopper sulphate dissociates into\ncopper and sulphate. The free copper\ngets drawn to the electrode connected\nto the negative terminal of the battery\nand gets deposited on it.  But what\nabout the loss of copper from the\nsolution?\nFrom the other electrode, a  copper\nplate, an equal amount of copper gets\ndissolved in the solution. Thus, the\nAfter doing the electroplating\nactivity, Paheli interchanged\nthe electrodes and repeated\nthe activity. What do you think\nshe would observe this time?\nFig.1 1.7 : A simple circuit showing\nelectroplatingCopper plate\nCopper sul-\nphate\nsolutionCopper plate\n2024-25\n\nCHEMICAL  EFFECTS  OF ELECTRIC  CURRENT 145\nloss of copper from the solution is\nrestored  and the process continues .\nThis means that copper gets\ntransferred from one electrode to the\nother .\nIn the electroplating factories the\ndisposal of the used conducting\nsolution is a major concern. It is a\npolluting waste and there are specific\ndisposal guidelines to protect the\nenvironment.Fig. 11.8 :  Some electroplated objects\nsilver and gold on less expensive metals.\nThese ornaments have the appearance\nof silver or gold but are much less\nexpensive.\nTin cans, used for storing food, ar e\nmade by electr oplating tin onto ir on. T in\nis less reactive than iron. Thus, food\ndoes not come into contact with iron and\nis protected from getting spoilt.\nIron is used in bridges and\nautomobiles to provide strength.\nHowever , iron tends to corr ode and rust.\nSo, a coating of zinc is deposited on iron\nto protect it from corrosion and\nformation of rust.\nBoojho could get only one\ncopper plate. So he\nperformed Activity 11.7 by\nconnecting a carbon rod in\nplace of the copper plate\nwhich was connected to\nthe negative terminal of\nthe battery. He succeeded\nin obtaining a coating of\ncopper on carbon rod.\nThe process of depositing a layer of\nany desired metal on another material\nby means of electricity is called\nelectroplating . It is one of the most\ncommon applications of chemical effects\nof electric current.\nElectroplating is a very useful\nprocess. It is widely used in industry\nfor coating metal objects with a thin\nlayer of a different metal (Fig.11.8). The\nlayer of metal deposited has some\ndesired property, which the metal of the\nobject lacks. For example, chromium\nplating is done on many objects such\nas car parts, bath taps, kitchen gas\nburners, bicycle handlebars, wheel rims\nand many others.\nChromium has a shiny appearance.\nIt does not corrode. It resists scratches.\nHowever , chromium is expensive and it\nmay not be economical to make the\nwhole object out of chromium. So the\nobject is made from a cheaper metal and\nonly a coating of chromium over it is\ndeposited.

What does\nthe distance moved by an object in unit\ntime indicate? Y ou also know that a\nmoving object like a ball rolling on the\nground slows down. Sometimes it may\nchange its direction of motion. It is also\npossible that the ball may slow down\nand also change its direction. Have you\never wondered what makes an object\nslow down or go faster , or change its\ndirection of motion?\nLet us recall some of our everyday\nexperiences. What do you do to make\na football move? What do you do to\nmake a moving ball move faster? How\ndoes a  goalkeeper stop a ball ? A\nhockey player changes the direction\nof the moving ball with a flick of the\nstick . How do fielders stop a\n ball hitby a batsman?  (Fig. 8.1). In all these\nsituations the ball is either made to\nmove faster or slower or its direction\nof motion is changed.\nWe often say that a for ce has been\napplied on a ball when it is kicked,\npushed, thrown or flicked.

W e shall seek answers to\nsuch questions in this chapter .\n8.1 Force \u2013 A Push or a Pull\nActions like picking, opening,\nshutting, kicking, hitting, lifting,\nflicking, pushing, pulling are often\nused to describe certain tasks. Each\nof these actions usually results in\nsome kind of change in the  state of\nmotion of an object.

Is attraction\nalso a pull? What about\nrepulsion between similar\npoles of two magnets? Is it a\npull or a push?Do you notice that each of the actions\ncan be grouped as a pull or a push or\nboth? Can we infer from this, that to move\nan object, it has to be pushed or pulled?\nIn science, a push or a pull on an\nobject is called a force . Thus, we can\nsay that the motion imparted to objects\nwas due to the action of a force. When\ndoes a force come into play?

Note that the\nman has to push the car to make it move.Fig. 8.2(a) : A man standing behind a stationary car\nFig. 8.3 (c) :  Who is pulling whom ?\nthe pair of girls in Fig. 8.3 (b) are trying\nto pull each other . Similarly, the cow\nand the man in Fig. 8.3 (c) appear to\npull each other . The girls in the two\nsituations shown here are applying force\non each other . Is it also true for the man\nand the cow?\nFrom these examples, we can infer\nthat at least two objects must interact\nfor a force to come into play. Thus, an\ninteraction of one object with another\nobject results in a force between the\ntwo objects.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 96Does it mean that the net\nforce on an object is zero if the\ntwo forces acting on it in\nopposite directions are equal?\nrope in their direction. Sometimes the rope\nsimply does not move. Is it not similar to\nthe situation shown in Fig. 8.3 (b)? The\nteam that pulls har der, that is, applies a\nlarger force, finally wins the game.\nWhat do these examples suggest\nabout the nature of force?\nForces applied on an object \nin the\nsame dir ection add  to one another . Now\nrecall what happened when you and\nyour friend pushed the heavy box in the\nsame direction in Activity 8.2.\nIf the two forces act in the opposite\ndirections on an object, the net force acting\non it is the difference between the two\nforces . What did you observe in Activity\n8.2 when both of you were pushing the\nheavy box from opposite directions?\nRecall that in the tug-of-war when\ntwo teams pull equally hard, the rope\ndoes not move in any direction.\nSo, we learn that a force could be\nlarger or smaller than the other or equal\nto each other . The strength of a force is\nusually expr essed by its magnitude . We\nhave also to specify the direction in\nwhich a force acts. Also, if the direction\nor the magnitude of the applied force\nchanges, its effect also changes.Activity 8.2\nChoose a heavy object like a table\nor a box, which you can move only\nby pushing har d. Try to push it all\nby yourself. Can you move it? Now\nask one of your friends to help you\nin pushing it in the same direction\n[Fig. 8.4(a)]. Is it easier to move it\nnow? Can you explain why?\nNow push the same object, but\nask your friend to push it from the\nopposite side [Fig. 8.4 (b)]. Does the\nobject move? If it does, note the\ndirection in which it moves.

However , the\neffect on the object is due to the net\nforce acting on it.\n8.4 A Force can Change the\nState of Motion\nLet us now find out what happens when\na force acts on an object.\nActivity 8.3\nTake a rubber ball and place it on a\nlevel sur face such as a table top or\na concr ete floor . Now, gently push\nthe ball along the level sur face\n(Fig. 8.6). Does the ball begin to\nmove? Push the ball again while it\nis still moving. Is there any change\nin its speed? Does it increase or\ndecrease?\nNext, place your palm in front\nof the moving ball. Remove your\npalm as soon as the moving ball\ntouches it. Does your palm apply a\nforce on the ball? What happens to\nthe speed of the ball now? Does it\nincrease or decrease? What would\nhappen if you let your palm hold\nthe moving ball?\nFig. 8.6  : A ball at rest begins to move\nwhen a force is applied on itI have seen\nchildren competing with one\nanother in moving a rubber tyre\nor a ring by pushing it\n(Fig. 8.7).  I now understand\nwhy the speed of the tyre\nincreases whenever it is\npushed.\nFig. 8.7 : To move a tyre faster it has to be\npushed repeatedly\nYou might r ecall similar situations.\nFor example, while taking a penalty kick\nin football, the player applies a force on\nthe ball. Before being hit, the ball was at\nrest and so its speed was zero. The\napplied force makes the ball move\ntowards the goal. Suppose, the\ngoalkeeper dives or jumps up to save the\ngoal. By his action the goalkeeper tries\nto apply a force on the moving ball. The\nforce applied by him can stop or deflect\nthe ball, saving a goal being scored. If\nthe goalkeeper succeeds in stopping the\nball, its speed decreases to zero.\nThese observations suggest that a\nforce applied on an object may change\nits speed. If the force applied on the object\nis in the direction of its motion, the speed\nof the object increases. If the force is\napplied in the direction opposite to the\ndirection of motion, then it results in a\ndecrease in the speed of the object.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 98Let us consider some more\nexamples. In a game of volleyball,\nplayers often push the moving ball to\ntheir team  mates to make a winning\nmove. Sometimes the ball is returned\nto the other side of the court by\npushing or smashing it. In cricket,  a\nbatsman plays his or her shot by\napplying a force on the ball with the\nbat. Is there any change in the\ndirection of motion of the ball in these\ncases? In all these examples the speed\nand the direction of the moving ball\nchange due to the application of a\nforce. Can you give a few more\nexamples of this kind?\nA change in either the speed of an\nobject, or its direction of motion, or both,\nis described as a change in its state of\nmotion . Thus, a force may bring a\nchange in the state of motion of an\nobject.\nFig. 8.8 : (a) A ball set in motion by\npushing it along a level surface\nand (b) the direction of motion\nof the ball after it strikes the\nruler placed in its path(a)State of Motion\nThe state of motion of an object is\ndescribed by its speed and the\ndirection of motion. The state of rest\nis considered to be the state of zero\nspeed. An object may be at rest or in\nmotion; both are its states of motion.Paheli is curious to know whether\napplication of a force can only change the\nspeed of an object. Let us find out.\nActivity 8.4\nTake a ball and place it on a level\nsurface as you did in Activity 8.3.\nMake the ball move by giving it a\npush [Fig. 8.8(a)]. Now place a ruler\nin its path as shown in Fig. 8.8(b).\nIn doing so, you would apply a force\non the moving ball. Does the ball\ncontinue to move in the same\ndirection after it strikes the ruler?\nRepeat the activity and try to\nobstruct the moving ball by placing\nthe ruler in such a way that it\nmakes different angles to its path.\nIn each case note your observations\nabout the direction of motion of the\nball after it strikes the ruler .\n(b)Does it mean that the application of\na force would always result in a change\nin the state of motion of the object? Let\nus find out.\nIt is common experience that many\na time application of force does not result\nin a change in the state of motion. For\nexample, a heavy box may not move at\nall even if you apply the maximum force\nthat you can exert. Again, no effect of\nforce is observed when you try to push\na wall.\n2024-25\n\nFORCE AND PRESSURE 998.5 Force can Change the\nShape of an Object\nDescription of\nSituationHow to Apply\nForceDiagram Action of Force\nChange in\nState of\nMotionChange in\nShape\nYes No Yes No\nPressing it down\nwith your hands.\nBy sitting on the\nseat.\nBy hanging a\nweight or by\npulling its free end.\nBy putting a weight\nat the centre of the\nscale.Table 8.2 : Studying the Effect of Force on Objects\nActivity 8.5\nSome situations have been given in Column 1 of Table 8.2 in which\nobjects are not free to move.

What\nhappens when you apply a force on\nan inflated balloon by pressing it\nbetween your palms? What happens\nto the shape of a ball of dough when it\nis rolled to make a chapati ? What\nhappens when  you press a rubber ball\nplaced on a table? In all these\nexamples you saw that the application\nof force on an object may change\nits shape .\nHaving per formed all the above\nactivities, you would have realised  that\na force\nlmay make an object move from rest.\nlmay change the speed of an object\nif it is moving.\nlmay change the direction of motion\nof an object.\nlmay bring about a change in the\nshape of an object.\nlmay cause some or all of these\neffects.\nWhile a force may cause one or more\nof these effects, it is important to\nremember that none of these actions can\ntake place without the action of a force.\nThus, an object cannot move by itself,\nit cannot change speed by itself, it\ncannot change direction by itself and\nits shape cannot change by itself.\n8.6 Contact Forces\nMuscular Force\nCan you push or lift a book lying on a\ntable without touching it? Can you lift\na bucket of water without holding it?\nGenerally, to apply a force on an object,\nyour body has to be in contact with the\nobject. The contact may also be with thehelp of a stick or a piece of rope.  When\nwe push an object like a school bag or\nlift a bucket of water, wher e does the\nforce come from? This force is caused\nby the action of muscles in our body.\nThe force resulting due to the action of\nmuscles is known as the muscular\nforce .\nIt is the muscular force that enables\nus to perform all activities involving\nmovement or bending of our body. In\nClass VII you have learnt that in the\nprocess of digestion the food gets\npushed through the alimentary canal.\nCould it be a muscular force that does\nit? You also know that lungs expand\nand contract while we inhale and\nexhale air during breathing. Where\nare these muscles located which\nmake breathing possible? Can you list\na few more examples of the force\nexerted by the muscles in our body?\nAnimals also make use of muscular\nforce to carry out their physical activities\nand other tasks. Animals like bullocks,\nhorses, donkeys and camels are used to\nperfor m various tasks for us. In\nperforming these tasks they use\nmuscular force (Fig. 8.9).\n2024-25\n\nFORCE AND PRESSURE 101Since muscular force can be applied\nonly when it is in contact with an object,\nit is also called a contact force . Are there\nother types of contact forces? Let us find\nout.\nFriction\nRecall some of your experiences. A ball\nrolling along the ground gradually slows\ndown and finally comes to rest. When\nwe stop pedalling a bicycle, it gradually\nslows down and finally comes to a stop.\nA car or a scooter also comes to rest\nonce its engine is switched off. Similarly,\na boat comes to rest if we stop rowing\nit. Can you add some more such\nexperiences?\nIn all these situations no force\nappears to be acting on the objects, yet\ntheir speed gradually decreases and\nthey come to rest after some time. What\ncauses a change in their state of motion?\nCould some force be acting on them!\nCan you guess the direction in which\nthe force must be acting in each case?\nThe force responsible for changing the\nstate of motion of objects in all these\nexamples is the force of friction . It is the\nforce of friction between the sur face of\nthe ball and the ground that brings the\nmoving ball to rest. Similarly, friction\nbetween water and the boat brings it to\na stop once you stop rowing.\nThe force of friction always acts on\nall the moving objects and its direction\nis always opposite to the direction of\nmotion. Since the force of friction arises\ndue to contact between sur faces, it is\nalso an example of a contact for ce. You\nwill learn more about this force in\nChapter 9.\nYou may be wondering whether it is\nessential for the agent applying a forceon an object to be always in contact with\nit. Let us find out.\n8.7 Non-contact Forces\nMagnetic Force\nActivity 8.6\nTake a pair of bar magnets. Place\nthe longer side of one of the magnets\nover three round shaped pencils or\nwooden rollers as shown in\nFig. 8.10. Now bring one end of the\nother magnet near the end of the\nmagnet placed on the rollers. Make\nsure that the two magnets do not\ntouch each other . Observe what\nhappens. Next, bring the other end\nof the magnet near the same end\nof the magnet placed on the rollers\n(Fig.8.10). Note what happens to\nthe magnet placed on the rollers\nevery time another magnet is\nbrought near it.\nFig. 8.10 :  Observing attraction and repulsion\nbetween two magnets\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 102 Fig.  8.11 : A straw rubbed with paper attracts\nanother straw but repels it if it has\nalso been rubbed with a sheet\nof paper\nA straw is said to have acquired\nelectrostatic charge after it has been\nrubbed with a sheet of paper . Such a\nstraw is an example of a charged body.\nThe force exerted by a charged body\non another charged or uncharged body\nis known as electrostatic force . This\nforce comes into play even when the\nbodies are not in contact. The\nelectrostatic force, therefore, is another\nexample of a non-contact for ce. You will\nlearn more about electric charges in\nChapter 12.\nGravitational Force\nYou know that a coin or a pen falls to the\nground when it slips off your hand.\nLeaves and fruits also fall to the ground\nwhen they get detached from the plant.\nHave you ever wondered why it is so?\nWhen the coin is held in your hand it\nis at rest. As soon as it is released, it\nbegins to move downwards. It is clear that\nthe state of motion of the coin undergoes\na change. Can this happen without a\nforce acting on it?  Which is this force?Does the magnet on the rollers begin\nto move when the other magnet is brought\nnear it? Does it always move in the\ndirection of the approaching magnet?\nWhat do these observations suggest? Does\nit mean that some force must be acting\nbetween the two magnets?\nYou have lear nt in Class VI that like\npoles of two magnets repel each other and\nunlike poles attract each other . Attraction\nor repulsion between objects can also be\nseen as another form of pull or push. Do\nyou have to bring the magnets in contact\nfor observing the force between them? A\nmagnet can exert a force on another\nmagnet without being in contact with it.\nThe force exerted by a magnet is an\nexample of a non-contact force .\nSimilarly, the force exerted by a\nmagnet on a piece of iron is also a\nnon-contact force.\nElectrostatic Force\nActivity 8.7\nTake a plastic straw and cut it into\nnearly two equal pieces. Suspend one\nof the pieces from the edge of a table\nwith the help of a piece of thread\n(Fig. 8.11). Now hold the other piece\nof straw in your hand and rub its\nfree end with a sheet of paper . Bring\nthe rubbed end of the straw near the\nsuspended straw. Make sure that the\ntwo pieces do not touch each other .\nWhat do you observe?\nNext, rub the free end of the\nsuspended piece of straw with a\nsheet of paper . Again, bring the\npiece of straw that was rubbed\nearlier with paper near the free end\nof the suspended straw. What do you\nobserve now?\n2024-25\n\nFORCE AND PRESSURE 103Objects or things fall towards the\nearth because it pulls them. This force\nis called the force of gravity , or just\ngravity. This is an attractive force. The\nforce of gravity acts on all objects. The\nforce of gravity acts on all of us all the\ntime without our being awar e of it. W ater\nbegins to flow towards the ground as\nsoon as we open a tap. W ater in rivers\nflows downward due to the force\nof gravity.Try cutting vegetables with a blunt\nknife  and then with a sharp knife. Which\nis easier?\nDo you get the feeling that the area\nover which the force is applied (for\nexample, the pointed end of the nail)\nplays  a role in making these tasks easier?\nThe force acting on a unit area of a\nsurface is called pr essure\n.\npressure = force / area on which it acts\nAt this stage we consider only those\nforces which act perpendicular to the\nsurface on which the pressure is to\nbe computed.Gravity is not a property of the earth\nalone. In fact, every object in the\nuniverse, whether small or large,\nexerts a force on every other object.\nThis force is known as the\ngravitational force .\n8.8 Pressure\nIs there any relation between pressure\nand force? Let us find out.\nTry to push a nail into a wooden\nplank by its head. Did you succeed? T ry\nnow to push the nail by the pointed end\n(Fig. 8.12). Could you do it this time?\nI now understand why\nporters place a round piece\nof cloth on their heads,\nwhen they have to carry\nheavy loads (Fig. 8.13). By\ndoing this they increase the\narea of contact of the load\nwith their head. So, the\npressure on their head is\nreduced and they find it\neasier to carry the load.\nFig. 8.13 : A porter carrying a heavy load\nFig. 8.12 : Pushing a nail into a wooden plank\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 104Note that the area is in the\ndenominator in the above expression.\nSo, the smaller the area, larger the\npressur e on a sur face for the same for ce.\nThe area of the pointed end of the nail\nis much smaller than that of its head.\nThe same force, therefore, produces a\npressure sufficient to push the pointed\nend of the nail into the wooden plank.\nCan you explain now why shoulder\nbags are provided with broad straps and\nnot thin strap? And, why the tools\nmeant for cutting and piercing always\nhave sharp edges?\nDo liquids and gases also exert\npressure? Does it also depend on the\narea on which the force acts?  Let us\nfind out.\n8.9 Pressure Exerted by\nLiquids and Gases\nActivity 8.8\nTake a transparent glass tube or a\nplastic pipe. The length of the pipe/\ntube should be about 25 cm and its\ndiameter should be 5-7.5 cm. Also\ntake a piece of thin sheet of a good\nquality rubber , say, a rubber\nballoon. Stretch the rubber sheet\ntightly over one end of the pipe.\nHold the pipe at the middle, keeping\nit in a vertical position (Fig. 8.14).\nAsk one of your friends to pour some\nwater in the pipe. Does the rubber\nsheet bulge out? Note also the\nheight of the water column in the\npipe. Pour some mor e water .\nObserve again the bulge in the\nrubber sheet and the height of the\nwater column in the pipe. Repeatthis process a few more times. Can\nyou see any relation between the\namount of the bulge in the rubber\nsheet and the height of the water\ncolumn in the pipe?\nFig. 8.14 : Pressure exerted by water at the\nbottom of the container depends\non the height of its column\nActivity 8.9\nTake a plastic bottle. Y ou can take\na discarded water or soft drink\nbottle. Fix a cylindrical glass tube,\na few cm long near its bottom as\nshown in Fig. 8.15. Y ou can do so\nby slightly heating one end of the\nglass tube and then quickly\ninserting it near the bottom of the\nbottle. Make sure that the water\ndoes not leak from the joint. If there\nis any leakage, seal it with molten\nwax. Cover the mouth of the glass\ntube with a thin rubber sheet as you\ndid in Activity 8.8. Now fill the bottle\nupto half with water .

Does the bulging of the\nrubber sheet in this case indicate that water\nexerts pressure on the sides of the container\nas well? Let us investigate further .\nActivity 8.10\nTake an empty plastic bottle or a\ncylindrical container . You can take\na used tin can or a used plastic\nbottle. Drill four holes all around\nnear the bottom of the bottle. Make\nsure that the holes are at the same\nheight from the bottom (Fig. 8.16).\nNow fill the bottle with water . What\ndo you observe?\nDo the different streams of water\ncoming out of the holes fall at the\nsame distance from the bottle? What\ndoes this indicate?Can you now say that liquids exert\npressure on the walls of the\ncontainer ?\nDo gases also exert pressure? Do\nthey also exert pressure on the walls of\ntheir containers? Let us find out.fixed to the glass tube bulge this\ntime? Pour some more water in the\nbottle. Is there any change in the\nbulge of the rubber sheet?\nFig. 8.16 : Liquids exert equal pressure at the\nsame depth\nI have seen fountains of water\ncoming out of the leaking joints\nor holes in pipes supplying\nwater .  Is it not due to the\npressure exerted by water on the\nwalls of the pipes?\nWhen you inflate a balloon, why do\nyou have to close its mouth? What\nhappens when you open the mouth of\nan inflated balloon? Suppose you have\na balloon which has holes. W ould you\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 106\nUnit area\nFig. 8.17 : Atmospheric pressure is the force of\ngravity on air in a column of unit areabe able to inflate it? If not, why? Can we\nsay that air exerts pressure in all\ndirections?\nDo you recall what happens to the\nair in the bicycle tube when it has a\npuncture? Do these observations suggest\nthat air exerts pressure on the inner walls\nof an inflated balloon or a  tube? So, we\nfind that gases, too, exert pressure on\nthe walls of their container .\n8.10 Atmospheric Pressure\nYou know that ther e is air all ar ound\nus. This envelop of air is known as the\natmosphere . The atmospheric air\nextends up to many kilometres above\nthe sur face of the earth. The pressure\nexerted by this air is known as\natmospheric pressur e\n. We know that\npressure is force per unit area. If we\nimagine a unit area and a very long\ncylinder standing on it filled with air ,\nthen the force of gravity on the air in\nthis cylinder is the atmospheric\npressure (Fig. 8.17).\nFig. 8.18 : A rubber sucker pressed on a\nsurface\nWhen you pr ess the sucker , most of\nthe air between its cup and the sur face\nescapes out. The sucker sticks to the\nsurface because the pr essure of\natmosphere acts on it. To pull the sucker\noff the sur face, the applied for ce should\nbe large enough to overcome the\natmospheric pressure. This activity\nmight give you an idea about the\nmagnitude of atmospheric pressure. In\nfact, it would not be possible for any\nhuman being to pull the sucker off the\nBut, how large or small is the\natmospheric pressure? Let us get an\nidea about its magnitude.\nActivity 8.11\nTake a good quality rubber sucker .\nIt looks like a small rubber cup (Fig.\n8.18). Press it hard on a smooth\nplane sur face. Does it stick to the\nsurface? Now try to pull it of f the\nsurface. Can you do it?\n2024-25\n\nFORCE AND PRESSURE 107\nIf the area of my head\nwere 15 cm \u00d7 15 cm, how\nmuch force air will exert\non my head?\nFig. 8.19 : Pressure of atmosphere on\nyour headsurface if ther e wer e no air at all between\nthe sucker and the sur face. Does it give\nyou an idea how large the atmospheric\npressure is?\nThe force due to air in a column of\nthe height of the atmosphere and area\n15 cm \u00d7 15 cm (Fig. 8.19) is nearly equal\nto the force of gravity on an object of\nmass 225 kg (2250N). The reason we\nare not crushed under this force of\ngravity is that the pressure inside our\nbodies is also equal to the atmospheric\npressure and balances the pressure from\noutside.\nDid you know?\nOtto von Guericke, a German scientist of the 17th century, invented a pump to\nextract air out of a vessel. With the help of this pump, he demonstrated\ndramatically the force of the air pressure. He joined two hollow metallic\nhemispheres of 51 cm diameter each and pumped air out of them. Then he\nemployed eight horses on each hemisphere to pull them apart (Fig. 8.20). So\ngreat is the force of air pressure that the hemispheres could not be pulled apart.\nFig. 8.20 :  Horses pulling the hemispheres\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 108\n     KEYWORDSKEYWORDSKEYWORDSKEYWORDSKEYWORDS\nATMOSPHERIC\nPRESSURE\nCONTACT FORCE\nELECTROSTATIC\nFORCE\nFORCE\nFRICTION\nGRAVITATIONAL\nFORCE\nGRAVITY\nMAGNETIC FORCE\nMUSCULAR FORCE\nNON-CONTACT\nFORCE\nPRESSURE\nPULL\nPUSH WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\n\u00dcForce could be a push or a pull.\n\u00dcA force arises due to the interaction between\ntwo objects.\n\u00dcForce has magnitude as well as direction.\n\u00dcA change in the speed of an object or the di-\nrection of its motion or both implies a change\nin its state of motion.\n\u00dcForce acting on an object may cause a change\nin its state of motion or a change in its shape.\n\u00dcA force can act on an object with or without\nbeing in contact with it.\n\u00dcForce per unit area is called pressure.\n\u00dcLiquids and gases exert pressure on the walls\nof their containers.\n\u00dcThe pressure exerted by air around us is\nknown as atmospheric pressure.\nExercises\n1.Give two examples each of situations in which you push or pull to change\nthe state of motion of objects.\n2.Give two examples of situations in which applied force causes a change in\nthe shape of an object.\n3.Fill in the blanks in the following statements.\n(a)To draw water from a well we have to __________ at the rope.\n(b)A charged body __________ an uncharged body towards it.\n(c)To move a loaded trolley we have to __________ it.\n(d)The north pole of a magnet __________the north pole of another\nmagnet.\n2024-25\n\nFORCE AND PRESSURE 109  4.An archer stretches her bow while taking aim at the target.

The existence of dif ferent\nkinds of matter is due to dif ferent atoms\nconstituting them. Now the questions arise:\n(i) What makes the atom of one element\ndifferent fr om the atom of another element?\nand (ii) Ar e atoms r eally indivisible, as\nproposed by Dalton, or ar e ther e smaller\nconstituents inside the atom? W e shall find\nout the answers to these questions in this\nchapter . We will lear n about sub-atomic\nparticles and the various models that have\nbeen pr oposed to explain how these particles\nare arranged within the atom.\nA major challenge befor e the scientists at\nthe end of the 19th century was to r eveal the\nstructur e of the atom as well as to explain its\nimportant pr operties. The elucidation of the\nstructur e of atoms is based on a series of\nexperiments.\nOne of the first indications that atoms ar e\nnot indivisible, comes fr om studying static\nelectricity and the condition under which\nelectricity is conducted by dif fer\nent\nsubstances.\n4.1Charged Particles in Matter\nFor understanding the natur e of char ged\nparticles in matter , let us carry out the\nfollowing activities:\nActivity ______________ 4.1\nA.Comb dry hair . Does the comb then\nattract small pieces of paper?\nB.Rub a glass r od with a silk cloth and\nbring the r od near an inflated balloon.\nObserve what happens.From these activities, can we conclude\nthat on rubbing two objects together , they\nbecome electrically char ged? Wher e does this\ncharge come fr om? This question can be\nanswer ed by knowing that an atom is divisible\nand consists of char ged particles.\nMany scientists contributed in r evealing\nthe pr esence of charged particles in an atom.\nIt was known by 1900 that the atom was\nindivisible particle but contained at least one\nsub-atomic particle \u2013 the electron identified by\nJ.J. Thomson. Even before the electron was\nidentified, E. Goldstein in 1886 discovered the\npresence of new radiations  in a gas discharge\nand called them canal rays. These rays were\npositively charged radiations which ultimately\nled to the discovery of another sub-atomic\nparticle. This sub-atomic particle had a charge,\nequal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that\nof the electron. Its mass was approximately\n2000 times as that of the electron. It was given\nthe name of proton. In general, an electron is\nrepresented as \u2018e\u2013\u2019 and a proton as \u2018p+\u2019. The\nmass of a proton  is taken as one unit and its\ncharge as plus one. The mass of an electron is\nconsidered to be negligible and its charge is\nminus one.\nIt seemed that an atom was composed of\nprotons and electrons, mutually balancing\ntheir charges. It also appeared that the protons\nwere in the interior of the atom, for whereas\nelectrons could easily be removed off but\nnot protons. Now the big question was:\nwhat sort of structure did  these particles of\nthe atom for m? W e will find the answer to\nthis question below.4\nS SS SSTRUCTURETRUCTURETRUCTURETRUCTURETRUCTURE      OF OFOFOFOF     THE THETHE THETHE A  A A  A ATOM TOMTOM TOMTOMChapter\n2024-25\n\nuestions\n1.What are canal rays?\n2.If an atom contains one electron\nand one pr oton, will it carry any\ncharge or not?\n4.2The Structure of an Atom\nWe have lear nt Dalton\u2019s atomic theory in\nChapter 3, which suggested that the atom\nwas indivisible and indestructible. But the\ndiscovery of two fundamental particles\n(electr ons and pr otons) inside the atom, led\nto the failur e of this aspect of Dalton\u2019s atomic\ntheory. It was then consider ed necessary to\nknow how electr ons and pr otons ar e arranged\nwithin an atom. For explaining this, many\nscientists pr oposed various atomic models.\nJ.J. Thomson was the first one to pr opose a\nmodel for the structure of an atom.\n4.2.1 THOMSON \u2019S MODEL  OF AN ATOM\nThomson proposed the model of an atom to\nbe similar to that of a Christmas pudding.\nThe electrons, in a spher e of positive charge,\nwere like currants (dry fruits) in a spherical\nChristmas pudding. W e can also think of a\nwater melon, the positive char ge in the atom\nis spr ead all over like the r ed edible part of\nthe water melon, while the electr ons ar e\nstudded in the positively char ged spher e, like\nthe seeds in the water melon (Fig. 4.1).Thomson pr oposed that:\n(i)An atom consists of a positively\ncharged spher e and the electr ons ar e\nembedded in it.\n(ii)The negative and positive char ges ar e\nequal in magnitude. So, the atom as a\nwhole is electrically neutral.\nAlthough Thomson\u2019s model explained that\natoms ar e electrically neutral, the results of\nexperiments carried out by other scientists\ncould not be explained by this model, as we\nwill see below.\n4.2.2 RUTHERFORD \u2019S MODEL  OF AN ATOM\nErnest Ruther ford was inter ested in knowing\nhow the electr ons ar e arranged within an\natom. Ruther ford designed an experiment for\nthis. In this experiment, fast moving alpha\n(\u03b1)-particles wer e made to fall on a thin\ngold foil.\n\u2022He selected a gold foil because he wanted\nas thin a layer as possible. This gold foil\nwas about 1000 atoms thick.\n\u2022\u03b1-particles ar e doubly-char ged helium\nions. Since they have a mass of 4 u, the\nfast-moving \u03b1-particles have a\nconsiderable amount of ener gy.\n\u2022It was expected that \u03b1-particles would be\ndeflected by the sub-atomic particles in\nthe gold atoms. Since the \u03b1-particles wer e\nmuch heavier than the pr otons, he did\nnot expect to see lar ge deflections.Q\nFig.4.1:  Thomson\u2019s model of an atomJ.J. Thomson (1856\u2013\n1940),  a British\nphysicist, was born in\nCheetham Hill, a suburb\nof Manchester , on\n18 December 1856. He\nwas awarded the Nobel\nprize in Physics in 1906\nfor his work on the\ndiscovery of electrons.

This is\nbecause there are lots of gaps in the fence\nwhich allow the stone to pass through them.\nFollowing a similar reasoning, Rutherford\nconcluded fr om the \u03b1-particle scattering\nexperiment that\u2014\n(i)Most of the space inside the atom is\nempty because most of the \u03b1 -particles\npassed thr ough the gold foil without\ngetting deflected.\n(ii) V ery few particles were deflected fr om\ntheir path, indicating that the positive\ncharge of the atom occupies very little\nspace.\n(iii) A very small fraction of \u03b1-particles\nwere deflected by 1800, indicating that\nall the positive char ge and mass of the\ngold atom were concentrated in a very\nsmall volume within the atom.\nFrom the data he also calculated that the\nradius of the nucleus is about 105 times less\nthan the radius of the atom.\nOn the basis of his experiment,\nRuther ford put forwar d the nuclear model of\nan atom, which had the following featur es:\n(i)There is a positively char ged centr e in\nan atom called the nucleus. Nearly all\nthe mass of an atom r esides in the\nnucleus.\n(ii)The electr ons r evolve ar ound the\nnucleus in circular paths.\n(iii) The size of the nucleus is very small\nas compar ed to the size of the atom.\nDrawbacks of Rutherford\u2019s model of\nthe atom\nThe revolution of the electron in a circular orbit\nis not expected to be stable. Any particle in a\ncircular orbit would undergo acceleration.\nDuring acceleration, charged particles would\nradiate energy. Thus, the revolving electron\nwould lose energy and finally fall into the\nnucleus. If this were so, the atom should be\nhighly unstable and hence matter would not\nexist in the for m that we know. W e know that\natoms are quite stable.E. Rutherford (1871\u20131937)\nwas bor n at Spring Gr ove\non 30 August 1871. He was\nknown as the \u2018Father\u2019 of\nnuclear physics.  He is\nfamous for his work on\nradioactivity and the\ndiscovery of the nucleus of an atom with\nthe gold foil experiment. He got the Nobel\nprize in chemistry in 1908.\nLet us think of an activity in an open field\nto understand the implications  of this\nexperiment.

Let him thr ow\nstones at the wall from a distance.\n2024-25\n\nSTRUCTURE  OF THE ATOM 414.2.3 BOHR\u2019S MODEL OF ATOM\nIn order to overcome the objections raised\nagainst Ruther ford\u2019s model of the atom,\nNeils Bohr put forwar d the following\npostulates about the model of an atom:\n(i)Only certain special orbits known as\ndiscrete orbits  of electr ons, ar e allowed\ninside the atom.\n(ii)While revolving in discr ete orbits the\nelectr ons do not radiate ener gy.uestions\n1.On the basis of Thomson\u2019s model\nof an atom, explain how the atom\nis neutral as a whole.\n2.On the basis of Ruther ford\u2019s\nmodel of an atom, which sub-\natomic particle is pr esent in the\nnucleus of an atom?\n3.Draw a sketch of Bohr\u2019s model\nof an atom with thr ee shells.\n4.What do you think would be the\nobservation if the \u03b1-particle\nscattering experiment is carried\nout using a foil of a metal other\nthan gold?\n4.2.4 NEUTRONS\nIn 1932, J. Chadwick discover ed another sub-\natomic particle which had no char ge and a\nmass nearly equal to that of a pr oton. It was\neventually named as neutr on. Neutr ons ar e\npresent in the nucleus of all atoms, except\nhydr ogen. In general, a neutr on is\nrepresented as \u2018n\u2019. The mass of an atom is\ntherefor e given by the sum of the masses of\nprotons and neutr ons pr esent in the nucleus.\nuestions\n1.Name the thr ee sub-atomic\nparticles of an atom.\n2.Helium atom has an atomic mass\nof 4 u and two pr otons in its\nnucleus. How many neutr ons\ndoes it have?\n4.3How are Electrons Distributed\nin Different Orbits (Shells)?\nThe distribution of electr ons into dif ferent\norbits of an atom was suggested by Bohr\nand Bury.\nThe following rules are followed for writing\nthe number of electr ons in dif ferent ener gy\nlevels or shells:\n(i)The maximum number of electr ons\npresent in a shell is given by theNeils Bohr (1885\u20131962)\nwas bor n in Copenhagen\non 7 October 1885. He was\nappointed pr ofessor of\nphysics at Copenhagen\nUniversity in 1916. He got\nthe Nobel prize for his work\non the structur e of atom in\n1922. Among Pr ofessor\nBohr\u2019s numer ous writings, thr ee appearing\nas books ar e:\n(i) The Theory of Spectra and Atomic\nConstitution, (ii) Atomic Theory and,\n(iii) The Description of Natur e.\nThese orbits or shells are called energy\nlevels. Energy levels in an atom ar e shown in\nFig. 4.3.Q\nFig. 4.3:  A few ener gy levels in an atom\nThese orbits or shells are represented by\nthe letters K,L,M,N,\u2026 or the numbers,\nn=1,2,3,4,\u2026.Q\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 42formula 2n2, where \u2018n\u2019 is the orbit\nnumber or energy level index, 1,2,3,\u2026.\nHence the maximum number of\nelectrons in different shells are as\nfollows:\nfirst orbit or K-shell will be = 2 \u00d7 12 = 2,\nsecond orbit or L-shell will be = 2 \u00d7 22 = 8,\nthird orbit or M-shell will be = 2 \u00d7 32 = 18,\nfourth orbit or N-shell will be = 2 \u00d7 42\n= 32, and so on.\n(ii)The maximum number of electrons that\ncan be accommodated in the outermost\norbit is 8.\n(iii)Electrons are not accommodated in a\ngiven shell, unless the inner shells are\nfilled. That is, the shells are filled in a\nstep-wise manner .\nAtomic structure of the first eighteen\nelements is shown schematically in Fig. 4.4.\u2022The composition of atoms of the first\neighteen elements is given in T able 4.1.\nuestions\n1.Write the distribution of electr ons\nin  carbon and sodium atoms.\n2.If K and L shells of an atom ar e\nfull, then what would be the total\nnumber of electr ons in the atom?\n4.4Valency\nWe have lear nt how the electr ons in an atom\nare arranged in dif ferent shells/orbits. The\nelectr ons pr esent in the outer most shell of\nan atom ar e known as the valence electr ons.\nFrom the Bohr -Bury scheme, we also know\nthat the outermost shell of an atom can\nActivity ______________ 4.2\n\u2022Make a static atomic model displaying\nelectronic configuration of the first\neighteen elements.Fig.4.4:  Schematic atomic structur e of the first eighteen elementsQ\naccommodate a maximum of 8 electrons. It\nwas observed that the atoms of elements,\ncompletely filled with 8 electrons in the\noutermost shell show little chemical activity.\nIn other words, their combining capacity or\nvalency is zero. Of these inert elements, the\n2024-25\n\nSTRUCTURE  OF THE ATOM 43Table 4.1: Composition of Atoms of the First Eighteen Elements\nwith Electron Distribution in Various Shells\nhelium atom has two electrons in its outermost\nshell and all other elements have atoms with\neight electrons in the outermost shell.\nThe combining capacity of the atoms of\nelements, that is, their tendency to react and\nform molecules with atoms of the same or\ndifferent elements, was thus explained as an\nattempt to attain a fully-filled outermost shell.\nAn outermost-shell, which had eight electrons\nwas said to possess an octet. Atoms would\nthus react, so as to achieve an octet in the\noutermost shell. This was done by sharing,\ngaining or losing electrons. The number of\nelectrons gained, lost or shared so as to make\nthe octet of electrons in the outermost shell,\ngives us directly the combining capacity of theelement, that is, the valency discussed in the\nprevious chapter . For example, hydr ogen/\nlithium/sodium atoms contain one electron\neach in their outermost shell, therefore each\none of them can lose one electron. So, they are\nsaid to have valency of one. Can you tell, what\nis valency of magnesium and aluminium? It\nis two and three, respectively, because\nmagnesium has two electrons in its outermost\nshell and aluminium has thr ee electr ons in\nits outer most shell.\nIf the number of electr ons in the\nouter most shell of an atom is close to its full\ncapacity, then valency is deter mined in a\ndifferent way. For example, the fluorine atom\nhas 7 electrons in the outermost shell, and its\nvalency could be 7.

Hence, its valency is determined\nby subtracting seven electrons from the octet\nand this gives you a valency of one for fluorine.\nValency can be calculated in a similar manner\nfor oxygen. What is the valency of oxygen that\nyou get from this calculation?\nTherefore, an atom of each element has a\ndefinite combining capacity, called its valency.\nValency of the first eighteen elements is given\nin the last column of T able 4.1.\nuestion\n1.How will you find the valency\nof chlorine, sulphur and\nmagnesium?\n4.5Atomic Number and Mass\nNumber\n4.5.1 ATOMIC  NUMBER\nWe know that pr otons ar e present in the\nnucleus of an atom. It is the number of\nprotons of an atom, which deter mines its\natomic number . It is denoted by \u2018Z\u2019. All atoms\nof an element have the same atomic number ,\nZ. In fact, elements ar e defined by the number\nof protons they possess. For hydrogen, Z = 1,\nbecause in hydr ogen atom, only one proton\nis pr esent in the nucleus. Similarly, for\ncarbon, Z = 6. Ther efore, the atomic number\nis defined as the total number of pr otons\npresent in the nucleus of an atom.\n4.5.2 MASS NUMBER\nAfter studying the pr operties of the sub-\natomic particles of an atom, we can conclude\nthat mass of an atom is practically due to\nprotons and neutr ons alone. These ar e\npresent in the nucleus of an atom. Hence\nprotons and neutr ons ar e also called\nnucleons. Ther efore, the mass of an atom\nresides in its nucleus. For example, mass of\ncarbon is 12 u because it has 6 pr otons and6 neutrons, 6 u + 6 u = 12 u. Similarly, the\nmass of aluminium is 27 u (13 protons+14\nneutrons). The mass number is defined as the\nsum of the total number of protons and\nneutrons present in the nucleus of an atom. It\nis denoted by \u2018A\u2019. In the notation for an atom,\nthe atomic number , mass number and symbol\nof the element are to be written as:\nMass Number\nQSymbol of\nelement\nAtomic Number\nFor example, nitrogen is written as 14\n7N.\nuestions\n1.If number of electrons in an atom\nis 8 and number of pr otons is also\n8, then (i) what is the atomic\nnumber of the atom? and (ii) what\nis the char ge on the atom?\n2.With the help of T able 4.1, find\nout the mass number of oxygen\nand sulphur atom.\n4.6Isotopes\nIn natur e, a number of atoms of some\nelements have been identified, which have the\nsame atomic number but dif ferent mass\nnumbers. For example, take the case of\nhydrogen atom, it has thr ee atomic species,\nnamely pr otium (1\n1H), deuterium (2\n1H or D)\nand tritium (3\n1H or T). The atomic number of\neach one is 1, but the mass number is 1, 2\nand 3, r espectively. Other such examples ar e\n(i) carbon, 12\n6C and 14\n6C, (ii) chlorine,  35\n17Cl\nand  37\n17Cl, etc.\nOn the basis of these examples, isotopes\nare defined as the atoms of the same element,\nhaving the same atomic number but dif ferent\nmass numbers. Ther efore, we can say that\nthere are three isotopes of hydrogen atom,\nnamely protium, deuterium and tritium.QXA\nZ\n2024-25\n\nSTRUCTURE  OF THE ATOM 45QMany elements consist of a mixture of\nisotopes. Each isotope of an element is a pure\nsubstance. The chemical pr operties of\nisotopes ar e similar but their physical\nproperties ar e different.\nChlorine occurs in natur e in two isotopic\nforms, with masses 35 u and 37 u in the ratio\nof 3:1. Obviously, the question arises: what\nshould we take as the mass of chlorine atom?\nLet us find out.\nThe average atomic mass of chlorine atom,\non the basis of above data, will be\n3575\n1003725\n100\u00d7 + \u00d7\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\uf8ef\n=\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\uf8fa+ = =105\n437\n4142\n435 5 . u\nThe mass of an atom of any natural element\nis taken as the average mass of all the naturally\noccuring atoms of that element. If an element\nhas no isotopes, then the mass of its atom\nwould be the same as the sum of protons and\nneutrons in it. But if an element occurs in\nisotopic forms, then we have to know the\npercentage of each isotopic form and then the\naverage mass is calculated.\nThis does not mean that any one atom of\nchlorine has a fractional mass of 35.5 u. It\nmeans that if you take a certain amount of\nchlorine, it will contain both isotopes of\nchlorine and the average mass is 35.5 u.Applications\nSince the chemical properties of all the\nisotopes of an element ar e the same,\nnormally we are not concer ned about\ntaking a mixture. But some isotopes have\nspecial properties which find them useful\nin various fields. Some of them are :\n(i)An isotope of uranium is used as a fuel\nin nuclear reactors.\n(ii)An isotope of cobalt is used in the\ntreatment of cancer .\n(iii) An isotope of iodine is used in the\ntreatment of goitr e.\n4.6.1 ISOBARS\nLet us consider two elements \u2014 calcium,\natomic number 20, and ar gon, atomic\nnumber 18. The number of protons in these\natoms is different, but the mass number of\nboth these elements is 40. That is, the total\nnumber of nucleons is the same in the atoms\nof this pair of elements. Atoms of different\nelements with different atomic numbers, which\nhave the same mass number , are known as\nisobars.\nuestions\n1.For the symbol H,D and T\ntabulate thr ee sub-atomic\nparticles found in each of them.\n2.Write the electronic\nconfiguration of any one pair of\nisotopes and isobars.\nWhat\nyou have\nlearnt\n\u2022 Credit for the discovery of electron and proton goes to J.J.\nThomson and E.Goldstein, respectively.\n\u2022 J.J.

The stability of the atom could not be\nexplained by this model.\n\u2022 Neils Bohr\u2019s model of the atom was mor e successful. He\nproposed that electr ons ar e distributed in dif ferent shells with\ndiscr ete ener gy ar ound the nucleus. If the atomic shells ar e\ncomplete, then the atom will be stable and less r eactive.\n\u2022 J. Chadwick discover ed pr esence of neutr ons in the nucleus of\nan atom. So, the thr ee sub-atomic particles of an atom are:\n(i) electr ons, (ii) pr otons and (iii) neutr ons. Electr ons ar e\nnegatively char ged, pr otons ar e positively char ged and neutr ons\nhave no char ges. The mass of an electr on is about 1\n2000  times\nthe mass of an hydr ogen atom. The mass of a pr oton and a\nneutr on is taken as one unit each.\n\u2022 Shells of an atom ar e designated as K,L,M,N,\u2026.\n\u2022 Valency is the combining capacity of an atom.\n\u2022 The atomic number of an element is the same as the number\nof protons in the nucleus of its atom.\n\u2022 The mass number of an atom is equal to the number of nucleons\nin its nucleus.\n\u2022 Isotopes ar e atoms of the same element, which have dif ferent\nmass numbers.\n\u2022 Isobars ar e atoms having the same mass number but dif ferent\natomic numbers.\n\u2022 Elements ar e defined by the number of pr otons they possess.\nExercises\n1.Compar e the pr operties of electrons, pr otons and neutr ons.\n2.What ar e the limitations of J.J.

This principle\nmarks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape\nour system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The\nsyllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to\nimplement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and\nthe maintenance of sharp boundaries between dif ferent subject ar eas. W e hope\nthese measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-\ncentred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and\nteachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to\npursue imaginative activities and questions. W e must r ecognise that, given\nspace, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with\nthe infor mation passed on to them by adults. T reating the pr escribed textbook\nas the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources\nand sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible\nif we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers\nof a fixed body of knowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of\nfunctioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in\nimplementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching\ndays are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and\nevaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making\nchildren\u2019s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or\nboredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular\nburden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with\ngreater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching.\nThe textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and\n2024-25\n\nspace to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small\ngroups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\nThe National Council of Educational Resear ch and T raining (NCER T)\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development team responsible\nfor this book. W e wish to thank the Chair man of the advisory gr oup in science\nand mathematics, Pr ofessor J.V . Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book,\nProfessor Rupamanjari Ghosh, School of Physical Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru\nUniversity, New Delhi, for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers\ncontributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to them and\ntheir principals for making this possible.

W e obtain most of this food\nfrom agricultur e and animal husbandry.\nWe read in newspapers that ef forts ar e\nalways being made to impr ove pr oduction\nfrom agricultur e and animal husbandry. Why\nis this necessary? Why we cannot make do\nwith the curr ent levels of pr oduction?\nIndia is a very populous country. Our\npopulation is mor e than one billion people,\nand it is still gr owing. As food for this gr owing\npopulation, we will soon need mor e than a\nquarter of a billion tonnes of grain every year .\nThis can be done by far ming on more land.\nBut India is alr eady intensively cultivated. As\na result, we do not have any major scope for\nincreasing the ar ea of land under cultivation.\nTherefore, it is necessary to incr ease our\nproduction ef ficiency for both cr ops and\nlivestock.\nEfforts to meet the food demand by\nincreasing food pr oduction have led to some\nsuccesses so far . We have had the gr een\nrevolution, which contributed to incr eased\nfood-grain pr oduction. W e have also had the\nwhite revolution, which has led to better and\nmore efficient use as well as availability of milk.\nHowever , these r evolutions mean that our\nnatural resources are getting used more\nintensively. As a result, there are more\nchances of causing damage to our natural\nresources to the point of destroying their\nbalance completely. Therefore, it is important\nthat we should increase food production\nwithout degrading our environment anddisturbing the balances maintaining it. Hence,\nthere is a need for sustainable practices in\nagriculture and animal husbandry.\nAlso, simply increasing grain production\nfor storage in warehouses cannot solve the\nproblem of malnutrition and hunger . People\nshould have money to purchase food. Food\nsecurity depends on both availability of food\nand access to it. The majority of our\npopulation depends on agriculture for their\nlivelihood. Increasing the incomes of people\nworking in agriculture is therefore necessary\nto combat the pr oblem of hunger . Scientific\nmanagement practices should be undertaken\nto obtain high yields from farms. For\nsustained livelihood, one should undertake\nmixed farming, intercropping, and integrated\nfarming practices, for example, combine\nagriculture with livestock/poultry/fisheries/\nbee-keeping.\nThe question thus becomes \u2013 how do we\nincrease the yields of crops and livestock?\n12.1Improvement in Crop Yields\nCereals such as wheat, rice, maize, millets and\nsorghum provide us carbohydrate for energy\nrequirement. Pulses like gram ( chana ), pea\n(\nmatar ), black gram ( urad), green gram ( moong ),\npigeon pea ( arhar ), lentil ( masoor ), provide us with\nprotein. And oil seeds including soyabean,\nground nut, sesame, castor , mustar d, linseed and\nsunflower provide us with necessary fats (Fig.\n12.1). V egetables, spices and fruits pr ovide a\nrange of vitamins and minerals in addition to\nsmall amounts of proteins, carbohydrates and\nfats. In addition to these food crops, fodder crops\nlike berseem , oats or sudan grass  are raised as\nfood for the livestock.12\nI II IIMPROVEMENTMPROVEMENTMPROVEMENTMPROVEMENTMPROVEMENT      IN ININININ F  F F  F FOOD OODOOD OODOOD R  R R  R RESOURCESESOURCESESOURCESESOURCESESOURCESChapter\n2024-25\n\nIMPROVEMENT  IN FOOD RESOURCES 141the kharif  season from the month of June to\nOctober , and some of the cr ops ar e grown in\nthe winter season, called the rabi season from\nNovember to April. Paddy, soyabean, pigeon\npea, maize, cotton, gr een gram and black\ngram are kharif  crops, whereas wheat, gram,\npeas, mustar d, linseed are rabi crops.\nIn India ther e has been a four times\nincrease in the production of food grains from\n1952 to 2010 with only 25% increase in the\ncultivable land ar\nea. How has this incr ease\nin pr oduction been achieved? If we think of\nthe practices involved in far ming, we can see\nthat we can divide it into thr ee stages. The\nfirst is the choice of seeds for planting. The\nsecond is the nurturing of the cr op plants.\nThe third is the pr otection of the growing and\nharvested cr ops from loss. Thus, the major\ngroups of activities for impr oving cr op yields\ncan be classified as:\n\u2022Crop variety improvement\n\u2022Crop pr oduction impr ovement\n\u2022Crop protection management.\n12.1.1 CROP VARIETY  IMPROVEMENT\nThis approach depends on finding a crop\nvariety that can give a good yield. V arieties or\nstrains of cr ops can be selected by breeding\nfor various useful characteristics such as\ndisease r esistance, r esponse to fertilisers,\nproduct quality and high yields. One way of\nincorporating desirable characters into cr op\nvarieties is by hybridisation. Hybridisation\nrefers to cr ossing between genetically\ndissimilar plants. This cr ossing may be\nintervarietal (between dif ferent varieties),\ninterspecific (between two dif ferent species of\nthe same genus) or inter generic (between\ndifferent genera). Another way of impr oving\nthe crop is by intr oducing a gene that would\nprovide the desir ed characteristic. This\nresults in genetically modified cr ops.\nFor new varieties of crops to be accepted,\nit is necessary that the variety pr oduces high\nyields under dif ferent conditions that ar e\nfound in dif ferent ar eas. Far mers would need\nto be provided with good quality seeds of a\nparticular variety, that is, the seeds should allFig. 12.1:  Different types of crops\nuestion\n1.What do we get fr om cer eals,\npulses, fruits and vegetables?\nDifferent crops r equir e different climatic\nconditions, temperatur e and photoperiods for\ntheir gr owth and completion of their life cycle.\nPhotoperiods ar e related to the duration of\nsunlight. Gr owth of plants and flowering ar e\ndependent on sunlight. As we all know, plants\nmanufactur e their food in sunlight by the\nprocess of photosynthesis. There are some\ncrops, which are grown in rainy season, called\nQ\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 142be of the same variety and germinate under\nthe same conditions.\nCultivation practices and crop yield are\nrelated to weather , soil quality and availability\nof water . Since weather conditions such as\ndrought and flood situations ar e\nunpr edictable, varieties that can be gr own in\ndiverse climatic conditions ar e useful.\nSimilarly, varieties tolerant to high soil  salinity\nhave been developed. Some of the factors for\nwhich variety impr ovement is done ar e:\n\u2022Higher yield: T o increase the\nproductivity of the cr op per acre.\n\u2022Impr oved quality: Quality\nconsiderations of cr op pr oducts vary\nfrom cr op to cr op. Baking quality is\nimportant in wheat, pr otein quality in\npulses, oil quality in oilseeds and\npreserving quality in fruits and\nvegetables.\n\u2022Biotic and abiotic r esistance: Cr ops\nproduction can go down due to biotic\n(diseases, insects and nematodes) and\nabiotic (dr ought, salinity, water\nlogging, heat, cold and fr ost) str esses\nunder dif ferent situations. V arieties\nresistant to these str esses can impr ove\ncrop production.\n\u2022Change in maturity duration: The\nshorter the duration of the cr op from\nsowing to harvesting, the mor e\neconomical is the variety. Such short\ndurations allow far mers to gr ow\nmultiple r ounds of cr ops in a year .\nShort duration also r educes the cost\nof crop pr\noduction. Unifor m maturity\nmakes the harvesting pr ocess easy\nand r educes losses during harvesting.\n\u2022Wider adaptability: Developing\nvarieties for wider adaptability will\nhelp in stabilising the cr op pr oduction\nunder dif ferent envir onmental\nconditions. One variety can then be\ngrown under dif ferent climatic\nconditions in dif ferent ar eas.\n\u2022Desirable agr onomic characteristics:\nTallness and pr ofuse branching ar e\ndesirable characters for fodder cr ops.\nDwarfness is desired in cereals, so thatless nutrients are consumed by these\ncrops. Thus developing varieties of\ndesired agronomic characters help give\nhigher productivity.\nuestions\n1.How do biotic and abiotic factors\naffect cr op pr oduction?\n2.What are the desirable agr onomic\ncharacteristics for crop\nimprovements?\n12.1.2 CROP PRODUCTION  MANAGEMENT\nIn India, as in many other agriculture-based\ncountries, farming ranges from small to very\nlarge farms. Different farmers thus have more\nor less land, money and access to information\nand technologies. In short, it is the money or\nfinancial conditions that allow farmers to take\nup different farming practices and agricultural\ntechnologies. There is a correlation between\nhigher inputs and yields. Thus, the farmer\u2019s\npurchasing capacity for inputs decides\ncropping system and production practices.\nTherefore, production practices can be at\ndifferent levels. They include \u2018no cost\u2019\nproduction, \u2018low cost\u2019 production and \u2018high\ncost\u2019 production practices.\n12.1.2 ( i)  NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT\nJust as we need food for development, growth\nand well-being, plants also require nutrients\nfor growth. Nutrients are supplied to plants\nby air , water and soil. Ther e are several\nnutrients which are essential for plants. Air\nsupplies carbon and oxygen, hydrogen comes\nfrom water , and soil supplies the other thirteen\nnutrients to plants. Amongst these, some are\nrequired in large quantities and are therefore\ncalled macro-nutrients. The other nutrients are\nused by plants in small quantities and are\ntherefore called micro-nutrients (Table 12.1).Q\n2024-25\n\nIMPROVEMENT  IN FOOD RESOURCES 143our environment from excessive use of\nfertilizers. Using biological waste material is\nalso a way of recycling farm waste. Based on\nthe kind of biological material used, manure\ncan be classified as:\n(i)Compost and vermi-compost: The\nprocess in which far m waste material\nlike livestock excreta (cow dung, etc.),\nvegetable waste, animal r efuse,\ndomestic waste, sewage waste, straw,\neradicated weeds etc. is decomposed\nin pits is known as composting. The\ncompost is rich in or ganic matter and\nnutrients. Compost is also prepared\nby using earthwor ms to hasten the\nprocess of decomposition of plant and\nanimal refuse. This is called\nvermi-compost.\n(ii)Green manure: Prior to the sowing of\nthe cr op seeds, some plants like sun\nhemp or guar ar e grown and then\nmulched by ploughing them into the\nsoil. These gr een plants thus tur n into\ngreen manure which helps in\nenriching the soil in nitrogen\nand phosphorus.\nFERTILIZERS\nFertilizers are commercially produced plant\nnutrients. Fertilizers supply nitr ogen,\nphosphorus and potassium. They ar e used\nto ensur e good vegetative gr owth (leaves,\nbranches and flowers), giving rise to healthy\nplants. Fertilizers are a factor in the higher\nyields of high-cost far ming.\nFertilizers should be applied car efully in\nterms of pr oper dose, time, and observing pr e-\nand post-application pr ecautions for their\ncomplete utilisation. For example, sometimes\nfertilizers get washed away due to excessive\nirrigation and ar e not fully absorbed by the\nplants. This excess fertilizer then leads to\nwater pollution.\nAlso, as we have seen in the pr evious\nchapter , continuous use of fertilizers in an\narea can destroy soil fertility because the\norganic matter in the soil is not replenished\nand micro-organisms in the soil are harmed\nby the fertilizers used. Short-term benefits of\nusing fertilizers and long-term benefits of usingDeficiency of these nutrients affects\nphysiological processes in plants including\nreproduction, growth and susceptibility to\ndiseases. To increase the yield, the soil can be\nenriched by supplying these nutrients in the\nform of manure and fertilizers.\nuestions\n1.What ar e macr o-nutrients and\nwhy ar e they called macr o-\nnutrients?\n2.How do plants get nutrients?\nMANURE\nManure contains lar ge quantities of or ganic\nmatter and also supplies small quantities of\nnutrients to the soil. Manur e is pr epared by\nthe decomposition of animal excr eta and plant\nwaste. Manure helps in enriching soil with\nnutrients and or ganic matter and increasing\nsoil fertility. The bulk of or ganic matter in\nmanur e helps in impr oving the soil structur e.\nThis involves incr easing the water holding\ncapacity in sandy soils. In clayey soils, the\nlarge quantities of organic matter help in\ndrainage and in avoiding water logging.\nIn using manure we use biological waste\nmaterial, which is advantageous in protectingTable 12.1: Nutrients supplied\nby air, water and soil\nAir carbon, oxygen\nWater hydrogen, oxygen\nSoil (i)Macronutrients :\nnitrogen, phosphorus,\npotassium, calcium,\nmagnesium, sulphur\n(ii)Micronutrients:\niron, manganese, boron,\nzinc, copper ,\nmolybdenum, chlorine\nQSource Nutrients\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 144India has a wide variety of water resources\nand a highly varied climate. Under such\nconditions, several different kinds of irrigation\nsystems are adopted to supply water to\nagricultural lands depending on the kinds of\nwater resources available. These include wells,\ncanals, rivers and tanks.\n\u2022Wells:  There ar e two types of wells,\nnamely dug wells and tube wells. In a\ndug well, water is collected fr om water\nbearing strata. Tube wells can tap\nwater fr om the deeper strata. Fr om\nthese wells, water is lifted by pumps\nfor irrigation.\n\u2022Canals:  This is usually an elaborate\nand extensive irrigation system. In this\nsystem canals r eceive water from one\nor mor e reservoirs or fr om rivers. The\nmain canal is divided into branch\ncanals having further distributaries to\nirrigate fields.\n\u2022River Lift Systems : In ar eas wher e\ncanal flow is insuf ficient or irr\negular\ndue to inadequate r eservoir r elease,\nthe lift system is mor e rational. W ater\nis dir ectly drawn fr om the rivers for\nsupplementing irrigation in ar eas\nclose to rivers.\n\u2022Tanks:  These ar e small storage\nreservoirs, which inter cept and stor e\nthe run-of f of smaller catchment\nareas.\nFresh initiatives for incr easing the water\navailable for agricultur e include rainwater\nharvesting and watershed management. This\ninvolves building small check-dams which\nlead to an incr ease in gr ound water levels.\nThe check-dams stop the rainwater fr om\nflowing away and also reduce soil erosion.\n12.1.2 ( iii)  CROPPING  PATTERNS\nDifferent ways of gr owing cr ops can be used\nto give maximum benefit.\nMixed cr opping is gr owing two or mor e\ncrops simultaneously on the same piece of\nland, for example, wheat + gram, or wheat +\nmustar d, or gr oundnut + sunflower . This\nreduces risk and gives some insurance\nagainst failur e of one of the cr ops.manure for maintaining soil fertility have to\nbe considered while aiming for optimum yields\nin crop production.\nuestion\n1.Compare the use of manure and\nfertilizers in maintaining soil\nfertility.\nOrganic far ming is a far ming system with\nminimal or no use of chemicals as fertilizers,\nherbicides, pesticides, etc., and with a\nmaximum input of or ganic manur es, recycled\nfarm-wastes (straw and livestock excr eta), use\nof bio-agents such as cultur e of blue green\nalgae in pr eparation of biofertilizers, neem\nleaves or tur meric specifically in grain storage\nas bio-pesticides, with healthy cr opping\nsystems [mixed cr opping, inter -cropping and\ncrop rotation as discussed below in 12.1.2.(iii)].\nThese cropping systems are beneficial in\ninsect, pest and wheat control besides\nproviding nutrients.\n12.1.2 ( ii)  IRRIGATION\nMost agriculture in India is rain-fed, that is,\nthe success of cr ops in most ar eas is\ndependent on timely monsoons and suf ficient\nrainfall spread thr ough most of the growing\nseason. Hence, poor monsoons cause cr op\nfailur e. Ensuring that the cr ops get water at\nthe right stages during their gr owing season\ncan incr ease the expected yields of any cr op.\nTherefor e, many measur es are used to bring\nmore and more agricultural land\nunder irrigation.Q\nMore to  knowDroughts occur because of scarcity or\nirregular distribution of rains. Drought\nposes a threat to rain-fed farming\nareas, where farmers do not use\nirrigation for crop production and\ndepend only on rain. Light soils have\nless water retention capacity. In areas\nwith light soils, crops get adversely\naffected by drought conditions.\nScientists have developed some crop\nvarieties which can tolerate drought\nconditions.\n2024-25\n\nIMPROVEMENT  IN FOOD RESOURCES 145Inter -cropping is gr owing two or mor e\ncrops simultaneously on the same field in a\ndefinite pattern (Fig.12.2). A few rows of one\ncrop alter nate with a few r ows of a second\ncrop, for example, soyabean + maize, or finger\nmillet (bajra ) + cowpea (lobia ). The crops are\nselected such that their nutrient\nrequir ements ar e dif ferent. This ensur es\nmaximum utilisation of the nutrients\nsupplied, and also pr events pests and\ndiseases fr om spr eading to all the plants\nbelonging to one cr op in a field. This way,\nboth crops can give better r eturns.(\ngokhroo ), Parthenium ( gajar ghas ), Cyperinus\nrotundus ( motha). They compete for food,\nspace and light. W eeds take up nutrients and\nreduce the growth of the crop. Therefore,\nremoval of weeds from cultivated fields during\nthe early stages of crop growth is essential for\na good harvest.\nGenerally insect pests attack the plants\nin thr ee ways: (i) they cut the r oot, stem and\nleaf, (ii) they suck the cell sap fr om various\nparts of the plant, and (iii) they bor e into stem\nand fruits. They thus af fect the health of the\ncrop and reduce yields.\nDiseases in plants ar e caused by\npathogens such as bacteria, fungi and  viruses.\nThese pathogens can be pr esent in and\ntransmitted thr ough the soil, water and air .\nWeeds, insects and diseases can be\ncontr olled by various methods. One of the\nmost commonly used methods is the use of\npesticides, which include herbicides,\ninsecticides and fungicides. These chemicals\nare sprayed on cr op plants or used for tr eating\nseeds and soil. However , excessive use of\nthese chemicals cr eates problems, since they\ncan be poisonous to many plant and animal\nspecies and cause envir onmental pollution.\nWeed contr ol methods also include\nmechanical r emoval. Pr eventive methods\nsuch as pr oper seed bed preparation, timely\nsowing of crops, inter cropping and cr op\nrotation also help in weed contr ol. Some other\npreventive measur es against pests ar e the use\nof resistant varieties, and summer ploughing,\nin which fields ar e ploughed deep in summers\nto destr oy weeds and pests.\nuestion\n1.Which of the following conditions\nwill give the most benefits? Why?\n(a)Farmers use high-quality\nseeds, do not adopt\nirrigation or use fertilizers.\n(b)Farmers use or dinary\nseeds, adopt irrigation and\nuse fertilizer .\n(c)Farmers use quality seeds,\nadopt irrigation, use\nfertilizer and use crop\nprotection measur es.Q\nFig. 12.2 : Intercropping\nThe growing of different crops on a piece\nof land in a pre-planned succession is known\nas crop r otation. Depending upon the\nduration, cr op rotation is done for dif ferent\ncrop combinations. The availability of moisture\nand irrigation facilities decide the choice of the\ncrop to be cultivated after one harvest. If crop\nrotation is done properly then two or three\ncrops can be grown in a year with\ngood harvests.\n12.1.3 CROP PROTECTION  MANAGEMENT\nField crops are infested by a large number of\nweeds, insect pests and diseases. If weeds and\npests ar e not contr olled at the appr opriate\ntime then they can damage the cr ops so much\nthat most of the cr op is lost.\nWeeds ar e unwanted plants in the\ncultivated field, for example, Xanthium\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 146Activity _____________ 12.1\n\u2022Visit a nearby garden/agricultural\nfield and make a list of the weeds and\nthe flowers/crops found in the area.\nAlso, make a list of insect pests, if\nany, infesting the flowers/crops.\nSTORAGE  OF GRAINS\nStorage losses in agricultural produce can be\nvery high. Factors responsible for such losses\nare biotic\u2014 insects, rodents, fungi, mites and\nbacteria, and abiotic\u2014 inappropriate moisture\nand temperatures in the place of storage. These\nfactors cause degradation in quality, loss in\nweight, poor germinability, discolouration of\nproduce, all leading to poor marketability.\nThese factors can be controlled by proper\ntreatment and by systematic management of\nwarehouses.\nPreventive and control measures are used\nbefore grains are stored for future use. They\ninclude strict cleaning of the produce before\nstorage, proper drying of the produce first in\nsunlight and then in shade, and fumigation\nusing chemicals that can kill pests.\nuestions\n1.Why should preventive measures\nand biological control methods be\npreferred for protecting crops?\n2.What factors may be responsible\nfor losses of grains during\nstorage?Activity _____________ 12.2\n\u2022Collect grains/seeds of cereals,\npulses and oil seeds and gather\ninformation about the seasons in\nwhich they are sown and harvested.\n12.2Animal Husbandry\nAnimal husbandry is the scientific\nmanagement of animal livestock. It includes\nvarious aspects such as feeding, br eeding and\ndisease contr ol. Animal-based far ming\nincludes cattle, goat, sheep, poultry and fish\nfarming. As the population incr eases and as\nliving standar ds incr ease, the demand for\nmilk, eggs and meat is also going up. Also,\nthe gr owing awar eness of the need for\nhumane tr eatment of livestock has br ought\nin new limitations in livestock farming. Thus,\nlivestock production also needs to be improved.\n12.2.1 CATTLE FARMING\nCattle husbandry is done for two purposes\u2014\nmilk and draught labour for agricultural work\nsuch as tilling, irrigation and carting. Indian\ncattle belong to two dif ferent species, Bos\nindicus , cows, and Bos bubalis , buf faloes.\nMilk-pr oducing females ar e called milch\nanimals (dairy animals), while the ones used\nfor far m labour are called draught animals.\nMilk production depends, to some extent,\non the duration of the lactation period,\nmeaning the period of milk production after QTable 12.2: Nutritional values of animal products\nAnimal\nProducts\nFat Protein Sugar Minerals Water Vitamins\nMilk (Cow) 3.60 4.00 4.50 0.70 87.20 B1, B2, B12, D, E\nEgg 12.00 13.00 * 1.00 74.00 B2, D\nMeat 3.60 21.10 * 1.10 74.20 B2, B12\nFish 2.50 19.00 * 1.30 77.20 Niacin, D, A\n*Present in very small amountsPer cent (%) Nutrients\n2024-25\n\nIMPROVEMENT  IN FOOD RESOURCES 147the birth of a calf. So, milk production can be\nincreased by increasing the lactation period.\nExotic or foreign breeds (for example, Jersey,\nBrown Swiss) are selected for long lactation\nperiods, while local breeds (for example, Red\nSindhi, Sahiwal) show excellent resistance to\ndiseases. The two can be cross-bred to get\nanimals with both the desired qualities.\nuestion\n1.Which method is commonly used\nfor impr oving cattle br eeds and\nwhy?\nActivity _____________ 12.3\n\u2022Visit a livestock farm. Note the\nfollowing:\n(1)Number of cattle and number of\ndifferent br eeds.\n(2)The amount of daily milk pr oduction\nfrom the dif ferent br eeds.\nProper cleaning and shelter facilities for\ncows and buf faloes are requir ed for humane\nfarming, for the health of the animals and\nfor pr oduction of clean milk as well. Animals\nrequire regular brushing to remove dirt andloose hair . They should be sheltered under\nwell-ventilated roofed sheds that protect them\nfrom rain, heat and cold. The floor of the cattle\nshed needs to be sloping so as to stay dry\nand to facilitate cleaning.\nThe food r equir ements of dairy animals\nare of two types: (a) maintenance\nrequir ement, which is the food r equir ed to\nsupport the animal to live a healthy life, and\n(b) milk pr oducing r equir ement, which is the\ntype of food r equir ed during the lactation\nperiod. Animal feed includes: (a) r oughage,\nwhich is largely fibr e, and (b) concentrates,\nwhich ar e low in fibre and contain r elatively\nhigh levels of pr oteins and other nutrients.\nCattle need balanced rations containing all\nnutrients in pr oportionate amounts. Besides\nsuch nutritious food material, certain feed\nadditives containing micr onutrients pr omote\nthe health and milk output of dairy animals.\nCattle suf fer from a number of diseases.\nThe diseases, besides causing death, r educe\nmilk pr oduction. A healthy animal feeds\nregularly and has a nor mal postur e. The\nparasites of cattle may be both exter nal\nparasites and inter nal parasites. The exter nal\nparasites live on the skin and mainly cause\nskin diseases. The inter nal parasites like\nworms, af fect stomach and intestine while\nflukes damage the liver . Infectious diseases\nare also caused by bacteria and viruses.\nVaccinations ar e given to far m animals\nagainst many major viral and bacterial\ndiseases.\n12.2.2 POULTRY FARMING\nPoultry farming is undertaken to raise\ndomestic fowl for egg pr oduction and chicken\nmeat. Ther efore, impr oved poultry br eeds ar e\ndeveloped and far med to pr oduce layers for\neggs and br oilers for meat.\nThe cr oss-br eeding pr ogrammes between\nIndian (indigenous, for example, Aseel) and\nforeign (exotic, for example, Leghor n) breeds\nfor variety impr ovement ar e focused on to\ndevelop new varieties for the following\ndesirable traits\u2014\n(i)number and quality of chicks;Q\nFig. 12.3: Indigenous milch breed of cattle\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 148(ii)dwarf broiler parent for commercial\nchick production;\n(iii)summer adaptation capacity/\ntolerance to high temperatur e;\n(iv)low maintenance r equir ements;\n(v)reduction in the size of the egg-laying\nbird with ability to utilise mor e\nfibrous cheaper diets for mulated\nusing agricultural by-pr oducts.The ration (daily food r equir ement) for br oilers\nis protein rich with adequate fat. The level of\nvitamins A and K is kept high in the poultry\nfeeds.\nPoultry fowl suf fer fr om a number of\ndiseases caused by virus, bacteria, fungi,\nparasites, as well as fr om nutritional\ndeficiencies. These necessitate pr oper\ncleaning, sanitation, and spraying of\ndisinfectants at r egular intervals. Appr opriate\nvaccination can pr event the occurr ence of\ninfectious diseases and r educe loss of poultry\nduring an outbr eak of disease.\nuestions\n1.What management practices are\ncommon in dairy and poultry\nfarming?\n2.What ar e the dif ferences between\nbroilers and layers and in their\nmanagement?\nActivity _____________ 12.4\n\u2022Visit a local poultry farm. Observe\ntypes of breeds and note the type of\nration, housing and lighting facilities\ngiven to them. Identify the growers,\nlayers and broilers.\n12.2.3 FISH PRODUCTION\nFish is a cheap source of animal protein for\nour food. Fish pr oduction includes the finned\ntrue fish as well as shellfish such as prawns\nand molluscs. Ther e are two ways of obtaining\nfish. One is fr om natural resour ces, which is\ncalled captur e fishing. The other way is by\nfish far ming, which is called cultur e fishery.\nThe water sour ce of the fish can be either\nseawater or fr esh water , such as in rivers and\nponds. Fishing can thus be done both by\ncaptur e and cultur e of fish in marine and\nfreshwater ecosystems.\n12.2.3 ( i) MARINE FISHERIES\nIndia\u2019s marine fishery resources include\n7500 km of coastline and the deep seasFig. 12.4Aseel Leghor n\nuestion\n1.Discuss the implications of the\nfollowing statement:\n\u201cIt is inter esting to note that\npoultry is India\u2019s most ef ficient\nconverter of low fibre food stuf f\n(which is unfit for human\nconsumption) into highly\nnutritious animal pr otein food.\u201d\nEGG AND BROILER  PRODUCTION\nBroiler chickens ar e fed with vitamin-rich\nsupplementary feed for good gr owth rate and\nbetter feed ef ficiency. Care is taken to avoid\nmortality and to maintain feathering and\ncarcass quality. They ar e produced as br oilers\nand sent to market for meat purposes.\nFor good pr oduction of poultry bir ds, good\nmanagement practices ar e important. These\ninclude maintenance of temperatur e and\nhygienic conditions in housing and poultry\nfeed, as well as pr evention and contr ol of\ndiseases and pests.\nThe housing, nutritional and\nenvir onmental r equir ements of br oilers ar e\nsomewhat dif ferent fr om those of egg layers.QQ\n2024-25\n\nIMPROVEMENT  IN FOOD RESOURCES 149beyond it. Popular marine fish varieties\ninclude pomphret, macker el, tuna, sar dines,\nand Bombay duck. Marine fish are caught\nusing many kinds of fishing nets fr om fishing\nboats. Y ields ar e incr eased by locating lar ge\nschools of fish in the open sea using satellites\nand echo-sounders.\nSome marine fish of high economic value\nare also far med in seawater . This includes\nfinned fishes like mullets, bhetki\n, and pearl\nspots, shellfish such as prawns (Fig. 12.5),\nmussels and oysters as well as seaweed.\nOysters ar e also cultivated for the pearls\nthey make.\nMacr obrachium r osenber gii\n(fresh water)Peneaus monodon\n(marine)\nFig. 12.5 :  Fresh water and marine prawns\nAs marine fish stocks get further depleted,\nthe demand for mor e fish can only be met by\nsuch cultur e fisheries, a practice called\nmariculture.\n12.2.3 ( ii)  INLAND  FISHERIES\nFresh water resources include canals, ponds,\nreservoirs and rivers. Brackish water\nresources, wher e seawater and fr esh water\nmix together , such as estuaries and lagoons\nare also important fish r eservoirs. While\ncaptur e fishing is also done in such inland\nwater bodies, the yield is not high. Most fish\nproduction fr om these r esour\nces is thr ough\naquacultur e.\nFish cultur e is sometimes done in\ncombination with a rice cr op, so that fish ar e\ngrown in the water in the paddy field. Mor e\nintensive fish far ming can be done in\ncomposite fish cultur e systems. Both local\nand imported fish species ar e used in such\nsystems.In such a system, a combination of five or\nsix fish species is used in a single fishpond.\nThese species ar e selected so that they do\nnot compete for food among them having\ndifferent types of food habits. As a r esult, the\nfood available in all the parts of the pond is\nused. As Catlas are sur face feeders, Rohus\nfeed in the middle-zone of the pond, Mrigals\nand Common Carps ar e bottom feeders, and\nGrass Carps feed on the weeds, together these\nspecies (Fig. 12.6) can use all the food in the\npond without competing with each other . This\nincreases the fish yield fr om the pond.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFig. 12.6: (a) Catla (b) Silver carp  (c) Rohu (d) Grass\nCarp (e) Mrigal (f) Common Carp(e)\n(f)\nOne problem with such composite fish\ncultur e is that many of these fish br eed only\nduring monsoon. Even if fish seed is collected\nfrom the wild, it can be mixed with that of\nother species as well. So, a major pr oblem in\nfish far ming is the lack of availability of good-\nquality seed. T o over come this pr oblem, ways\nhave now been worked out to br eed these fish\nin ponds using hor monal stimulation. This\nhas ensur ed the supply of pure fish seed in\ndesired quantities.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 150uestions\n1.How are fish obtained?\n2.What ar e the advantages of\ncomposite fish cultur e?\nActivity _____________ 12.5\n\u2022Visit a fish farm in fish breeding\nseason and note the following:\n(1)Varieties of fish in fish far m\n(2)Types of ponds\n(3)Feed ingredients used\n(4)Production capacity of the farm\nIf there are no fish farms close to your\nlocality, gather the above information from\nInternet, by referring books or talking to\npeople who are engaged in fishery.\n12.2.4 BEE-KEEPING\nHoney is widely used and ther efore bee-\nkeeping for making honey has become an\nagricultural enterprise. Since bee-keeping\nneeds low investments, far mers use it as an\nadditional income generating activity. In\naddition to honey, the beehives ar e a source\nof wax which is used in various medicinal\npreparations.\nThe local varieties of bees used for\ncommer cial honey pr oduction ar e Apis cerana\nindica , commonly known as the Indian bee,\nA. dorsata,  the rock bee and A. florae,  the little\nbee. An Italian bee variety, A. mellifera, has\nalso been brought in to increase yield of honey.This is the variety commonly used for\ncommercial honey production.\nThe Italian bees have high honey collection\ncapacity. They sting somewhat less. They stay\nin a given beehive for long periods, and breed\nvery well. For commercial honey production,\nbee farms or apiaries are established.\nThe value or quality of honey depends\nupon the pasturage, or the flowers available\nto the bees for nectar and pollen collection.\nIn addition to adequate quantity of pasturage,\nthe kind of flowers available will deter mine\nthe taste of the honey.\nuestions\n1.What ar e the desirable\ncharacters of bee varieties\nsuitable for honey production?\n2.What is pasturage and how is it\nrelated to honey production?Q\n(a) (b)\nFig. 12.7:  (a) Arrangement of beehive in an apiary\n(b) honey extractor\nQ\nWhat\nyou have\nlearnt\n\u2022 There are several nutrients essential for crops. Of these,\nsome are required in large quantities and are known as\nmacro-nutrients whereas rest of the nutrients are required\nin small quantities and are known as micro-nutrients.\n\u2022 Manure and fertilizers are the main sources of nutrient\nsupply to crops.\n\u2022 Organic farming is a farming system with minimal or no use\nof chemicals as fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides etc. and\n2024-25\n\nIMPROVEMENT  IN FOOD RESOURCES 151\nwith a maximum input of organic manures, recyled farm wastes, and\nbio-agents, with healthy cropping systems.\n\u2022 Mixed farming is a system of farming on a particular farm which\nincludes crop production, raising of livestock etc.\n\u2022 Mixed cropping is growing of two or more crops simultaneously on the\nsame piece of land.\n\u2022 Growing two or mor e crops in definite r ow patter ns is known as inter -\ncropping.\n\u2022 The growing of different crops on a piece of land in pre-planned\nsuccession is called crop rotation.\n\u2022 Varietal impr ovement is requir ed for higher yield, good quality, biotic\nand abiotic resistance, shortening the maturity duration, wider\nadaptability and desirable agronomic characteristics.\n\u2022 Farm animals requir e proper car e and management such as shelter ,\nfeeding, breeding and disease control. This is called animal husbandry.\n\u2022 Poultry farming is done to raise domestic fowls. Poultry production\nincludes egg production and broiler production for poultry meat.\n\u2022 To enhance poultry production, cross breeding is done between Indian\nand exotic breeds for variety improvement.\n\u2022 Fish may be obtained from marine resources as well as inland\nresources.\n\u2022 To increase production of fish, they can be cultured in marine and\ninland ecosystems.\n\u2022 Marine fish capture is done by fishing nets guided by echo-sounders\nand satellites.\n\u2022 Composite fish culture system is commonly used for\nfish farming.\n\u2022 Bee-keeping is done to get honey and wax.\nExercises\n1. Explain any one method of crop production which ensures high yield.\n2. Why are manure and fertilizers used in fields?\n3. What ar e the advantages of inter -cropping and cr op rotation?\n4. What is genetic manipulation? How is it useful in agricultural practices?\n5. How do storage grain losses occur?\n6. How do good animal husbandry practices benefit farmers?\n7. What are the benefits of cattle farming?\n8. For increasing production, what is common in poultry, fisheries and\nbee-keeping?\n9.

W e have lear nt\nthat a force is needed to change the speed or\nthe dir ection of motion of an object. W e always\nobserve that an object dropped from a height\nfalls towar ds the earth. W e know that all the\nplanets go around the Sun. The moon goes\naround the earth. In all these cases, there must\nbe some force acting on the objects, the planets\nand on the moon. Isaac Newton could grasp\nthat the same force is responsible for all these.\nThis force is called the gravitational force.\nIn this chapter we shall learn about\ngravitation and the universal law of\ngravitation. W e shall discuss the motion of\nobjects under the influence of gravitational\nforce on the earth. W e shall study how the\nweight of a body varies fr om place to place.\nWe shall also discuss the conditions for\nobjects to float in liquids.\n9.1Gravitation\nWe know that the moon goes ar ound the earth.\nAn object when thrown upwards, reaches a\ncertain height and then falls downwards. It is\nsaid that when Newton was sitting under a tree,\nan apple fell on him. The fall of the apple made\nNewton start thinking. He thought that: if the\nearth can attract an apple, can it not attract\nthe moon? Is the force the same in both cases?\nHe conjectured  that the same type of force is\nresponsible in both the cases. He argued that\nat each point of its orbit, the moon falls\ntowards the earth, instead of going off in a\nstraight line. So, it must be attracted by the\nearth. But we do not really see the moon falling\ntowards the earth.Let us try to understand the motion of the\nmoon by recalling activity 7.11.\nActivity ______________ 9.1\n\u2022Take a piece of thread.\n\u2022Tie a small stone at one end. Hold the\nother end of the thread and whirl it\nround, as shown in Fig. 9.1.\n\u2022Note the motion of the stone.\n\u2022Release the thread.\n\u2022Again, note the direction of motion of\nthe stone.\nFig. 9.1: A stone describing a circular path with a\nvelocity of constant magnitude.\nBefore the thread is released, the stone\nmoves in a circular path with a certain speed\nand changes direction at every point.\nThe change in direction involves change in\nvelocity or acceleration. The force that causes\nthis acceleration and keeps the body moving\nalong the circular path is acting towards\nthe centre. This force is called the\ncentripetal (meaning \u2018centre-seeking\u2019) force.9\nG GG GGRAVITATIONRAVITATIONRAVITATIONRAVITATIONRAVITATIONChapter\n2024-25\n\nGRAVITATION 1019.1.1 UNIVERSAL  LAW OF GRAVITATION\nEvery object in the universe attracts every\nother object with a for ce which is pr oportional\nto the pr oduct of their masses and inversely\nproportional to the squar e of the distance\nbetween them. The for ce is along the line\njoining the centr es of two objects.In the absence of this force, the stone flies off\nalong a straight line. This straight line will be\na tangent to the circular path.\nMore to  knowTangent to a circle\nA straight line that meets the circle at\none and only one point is called a\ntangent to the cir cle. Straight line\nABC is a tangent to the circle at\npoint B.\nThe motion of the moon ar ound the earth\nis due to the centripetal for ce. The centripetal\nforce is pr ovided by the force of attraction of\nthe earth. If ther e wer e no such for ce, the\nmoon would pursue a unifor m straight line\nmotion.\nIt is seen that a falling apple is attracted\ntowar ds the earth. Does the apple attract the\nearth? If so, we do not see the earth moving\ntowar ds an apple. Why?\nAccor\nding to the thir d law of motion, the\napple does attract the earth. But accor ding\nto the second law of motion, for a given for ce,\nacceleration is inversely pr oportional to the\nmass of an object [Eq. (8.4)]. The mass of an\napple is negligibly small compar ed to that of\nthe earth. So, we do not see the earth moving\ntowar ds the apple. Extend the same ar gument\nfor why the earth does not move towar ds the\nmoon.\nIn our solar system, all the planets go\naround the Sun. By ar guing the same way,\nwe can say that ther e exists a force between\nthe Sun and the planets. Fr om the above facts\nNewton concluded that not only does the\nearth attract an apple and the moon, but all\nobjects in the universe attract each other . This\nforce of attraction between objects is called\nthe gravitational force.G2Mm\nF =\nd\nFig. 9.2: The gravitational force between two\nuniform objects is directed along the line\njoining their centres.\nLet two objects A and B of masses M and\nm lie at a distance d from each other as shown\nin Fig. 9.2.

But for objects\nfar from the earth, the acceleration due to\ngravitational for ce of earth is given by\nEq. (9.7).\n9.2.1 TO CALCULATE  THE VALUE  OF g\nTo calculate the value of g, we should put   the\nvalues of G, M and R  in Eq. (9.9), namely,\nuniversal gravitational constant,   G = 6.7 \u00d7 10\u201311\nN m2 kg-2, mass of the earth, M = 6 \u00d7 1024 kg,\nand radius of the earth,  R = 6.4 \u00d7 106 m.\nG2M\ng =\nR\n-11 2 -2 24\n6 26.7 10 N m kg 6 10 kg=\n(6.4 10 m)\u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\n\u00d7\n      = 9.8 m s\u20132.\nThus, the value of acceleration due to gravity\nof the earth, g  = 9.8 m s\u20132.\n9.2.2 MOTION  OF OBJECTS  UNDER  THE\nINFLUENCE  OF GRAVITATIONAL\nFORCE  OF THE EARTH\nLet us do an activity to understand whether\nall objects hollow or solid, big or small, will\nfall from a height at the same rate.\nActivity                          9.3Activity                          9.3Activity                          9.3Activity                          9.3Activity                          9.3\n\u2022Take a sheet of paper and a stone.\nDrop them simultaneously from the\nfirst floor of a building. Observe\nwhether both of them reach the\nground simultaneously.\n\u2022We see that paper r eaches the gr ound\nlittle later than the stone. This happens\nbecause of air r esistance. The air of fers\nresistance due to friction to the motion\nof the falling objects. The r esistance\noffered by air to the paper is mor e than\nthe resistance offered to the stone. If\nwe do the experiment in a glass jar\nfrom which air has been sucked out,\nthe paper and the stone would fall at\nthe same rate.change in the velocity of falling objects? While\nfalling, there is no change in the direction of\nmotion of the objects. But due to the earth\u2019s\nattraction, there will be a change in the\nmagnitude of the velocity. Any change in\nvelocity involves acceleration. Whenever an\nobject falls towar ds the earth, an acceleration\nis involved. This acceleration is due to the\nearth\u2019s gravitational for ce. Ther efore, this\nacceleration is called the acceleration due to\nthe gravitational for ce of the earth (or\nacceleration due to gravity). It is denoted by\ng. The unit of g is the same as that of\nacceleration, that is, m s\u20132.\nWe know fr om the second law of motion\nthat for ce is the pr oduct of mass and\nacceleration. Let the mass of the stone in\nactivity 9.2 be m. We already know that ther e\nis acceleration involved in falling objects due\nto the gravitational force and is denoted by g.\nTherefor e the magnitude of the gravitational\nforce F will be equal to the pr oduct of mass\nand acceleration due to the gravitational\nforce, that is,\nF = m g (9.6)\nFrom Eqs. (9.4) and (9.6) we have\n2= G\u00d7M m\nm g\nd\nor G2M\ng =\nd(9.7)\nwhere M is the mass of the earth, and d is the\ndistance between the object and the earth.\nLet an object be on or near the sur face of\nthe earth. The distance d in Eq. (9.7) will be\nequal to R, the radius of the earth. Thus, for\nobjects on or near the sur face of the earth,\nG2M \u00d7 m\nmg =\nR(9.8)\n  G2M\ng =\nR(9.9)\nThe earth is not a perfect sphere. As the\nradius of the earth increases from the poles to\nthe equator , the value of g becomes gr eater at\nthe poles than at the equator . For most\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 104We know that an object experiences\nacceleration during free fall. From Eq. (9.9),\nthis acceleration experienced by an object is\nindependent of its mass. This means that all\nobjects hollow or solid, big or small, should\nfall at the same rate. According to a story,\nGalileo dr opped dif ferent objects fr om the top\nof the Leaning T ower of Pisa in Italy to prove\nthe same.\nAs g is constant near the earth, all the\nequations for the unifor mly accelerated\nmotion of objects become valid with\nacceleration a replaced by g.\nThe equations are:\nv = u + at (9.10)\ns = ut + 1\n2 at2(9.11)\nv2 = u2 + 2as (9.12)\nwhere u and v are the initial and final velocities\nand s is the distance covered in    time, t.\nIn applying these equations, we will take\nacceleration, a to be positive when it is in the\ndirection of the velocity, that is, in the\ndirection of motion. The acceleration, a  will\nbe taken as negative when it opposes the\nmotion.\nExampl e 9.2 A car falls off a ledge and\ndrops to the ground in 0.5 s.

It remains the same\nwhether the object is on the earth, the moon\nor even in outer space. Thus, the mass of an\nobject is constant and does not change from\nplace to place.\n9.4Weight\nWe know that the earth attracts every object\nwith a certain force and this force depends on\nthe mass ( m) of the object and the acceleration\ndue to the gravity (g ). The weight of an object\nis the force with which it is attracted towards\nthe earth.\nWe know that\nF = m \u00d7 a, (9.13)\nthat is,\nF = m \u00d7 g. (9.14)\nThe force of attraction of the earth on an\nobject is known as the weight of the object. It\nis denoted by W. Substituting the same in Eq.\n(9.14), we have\nW = m \u00d7 g (9.15)\nAs the weight of an object is the force with\nwhich it is attracted towards the earth, the SI\nunit of weight is the same as that of force, that\nis, newton (N). The weight is a force acting\nvertically downwards; it has both magnitude\nand direction.\nWe have lear nt that the value of g is\nconstant at a given place. Therefore at a given\nplace, the weight of an object is directly\nproportional to the mass, say m, of the object,\nthat is, W \u221d m. It is due to this reason that at\na given place, we can use the weight of an\nobject as a measure of its mass. The mass of\nan object remains the same everywhere, that\nis, on the earth and on any planet whereas its\nweight depends on its location because g\ndepends on location.\n9.4.1 WEIGHT  OF AN OBJECT ON\nTHE MOON\nWe have lear nt that the weight of an object on\nthe earth is the force with which the earthattracts the object. In the same way, the weight\nof an object on the moon is the force with\nwhich the moon attracts that object. The mass\nof the moon is less than that of the earth. Due\nto this the moon exerts lesser force of attraction\non objects.\nLet the mass of an object be m. Let its\nweight on the moon be Wm. Let the mass of\nthe moon be Mm and its radius be Rm.\nBy applying the universal law of\ngravitation, the weight of the object on the\nmoon will be\n2G\u00d7=m\nm\nmM mW\nR(9.16)\nLet the weight of the same object on the\nearth be We. The mass of the earth is M and its\nradius is R.\nTable 9.1\nCelestial Mass (kg) Radius (m)\nbody\nEarth 5.98 \u00d7  10246.37 \u00d7\u00d7106\nMoon 7.36 \u00d7\u00d710221.74 \u00d7\u00d7106\nFrom Eqs. (9.9) and (9.15) we have,\n2G\u00d7=eM mW\nR (9.17)\nSubstituting the values from Table 10.1 in\nEqs. (9.16) and (9.17), we get\n( )22\n267.36 10 kgG\n1.74 10\nm\u00d7 \u00d7=\n\u00d7mmW\n 102.431 10 G \u00d7 = \u00d7mW m (9.18a)\nand 111.474 10 G \u00d7 = \u00d7eW m (9.18b)\nDividing Eq.

Why an ar my tank weighing\nmore than a thousand tonne r ests upon a\ncontinuous chain? Why a truck or a motorbus\nhas much wider tyr es? Why cutting tools have\nsharp edges? In order to address these\nquestions and understand the phenomena\ninvolved, it helps to intr oduce the conceptsof the net force in a particular direction (thrust)\nand the force per unit area (pressure) acting\non the object concerned.\nLet us try to understand the meanings of\nthrust and pr essur e by considering the\nfollowing situations:\nSituation 1: Y ou wish to fix a poster on a\nbulletin board, as shown in Fig 9.3. To do this\ntask you will have to press drawing pins with\nyour thumb. Y ou apply a for ce on the sur face\narea of the head of the pin. This force is directed\nperpendicular to the surface area of the board.\nThis force acts on a smaller area at the tip of\nthe pin.\nQ\nFig. 9.3: To fix a poster , drawing pins ar e pressed\nwith the thumb perpendicular to the boar d.\nSituation 2: Y ou stand on loose sand. Y our\nfeet go deep into the sand. Now, lie down on\nthe sand. Y ou will find that your body will not\ngo that deep in the sand. In both cases the\nforce exerted on the sand is the weight of your\nbody.\n2024-25\n\nGRAVITATION 107You have lear nt that weight is the for ce\nacting vertically downwards. Here the force is\nacting perpendicular to the surface of the sand.\nThe force acting on an object perpendicular to\nthe surface is called thrust.\nWhen you stand on loose sand, the for ce,\nthat is, the weight of your body is acting on\nan ar ea equal to ar ea of your feet. When you\nlie down, the same for ce acts on an ar ea equal\nto the contact ar ea of your whole body, which\nis lar ger than the ar ea of your feet. Thus, the\neffects of for ces of the same magnitude on\ndifferent ar eas ar e different. In the above\ncases, thrust is the same. But ef fects ar e\ndifferent. Ther efore the ef fect of thrust\ndepends on the ar ea on which it acts.\nThe ef fect of thrust on sand is lar ger while\nstanding than while lying. The thrust on unit\narea is called pressur e. Thus,\nthrustPressure=\narea(9.20)\nSubstituting the SI unit of thrust and area in\nEq. (9.20), we get the SI unit of pressure as N/\nm2 or N m\u20132.\nIn honour of scientist Blaise Pascal, the\nSI unit of pr essur e is called pascal, denoted\nas Pa.\nLet us consider a numerical example to\nunderstand the ef fects of thrust acting on\ndifferent areas.\nExampl e 9.6 A block of wood is kept on a\ntabletop. The mass of wooden block is 5\nkg and its dimensions are 40 cm \u00d7 20\ncm \u00d7 10 cm. Find the pr essur e exertedby the wooden block on the table top if\nit is made to lie on the table top with its\nsides of dimensions (a) 20 cm \u00d7  10 cm\nand (b) 40 cm \n\u00d7 20 cm.\nSolution:\nThe mass of the wooden block = 5 kg\nThe dimensions\n= 40 cm \u00d7  20 cm \u00d7  10 cm\nHere, the weight of the wooden block\napplies a thrust on the table top.\nThat is,\n  Thrust = F = m \u00d7 g\n=5 kg \u00d7 9.8 m s\u20132\n=49 N\nArea of a side = length \u00d7 breadth\n=20 cm \u00d7 10 cm\n=200 cm2 = 0.02 m2\nFrom Eq. (9.20),\nPressur e = 249N\n0.02m\n= 2450 N m-2.\nWhen the block lies on its side of\ndimensions 40 cm \u00d7 20 cm, it exerts\nthe same thrust.\nArea=length \u00d7 breadth\n=40 cm \u00d7 20 cm\n=800 cm2 = 0.08 m2\nFrom Eq. (9.20),\nPressur e\n= 249 N\n0.08 m\n=612.5 N m\u20132\nThe pr essur e exerted by the side 20 cm\n\u00d7 10 cm is 2450 N m\u20132 and by the side\n40 cm \u00d7 20 cm is 612.5 N m\u20132.\nThus, the same for ce acting on a smaller\narea exerts a larger pressure, and a smaller\npressure on a larger area. This is the reason\nwhy a nail has a pointed tip, knives have sharp\nedges and buildings have wide foundations.\n9.5.1 PRESSURE  IN FLUIDS\nAll liquids and gases are fluids. A solid exerts\npressur e on a sur face due to its weight.\nSimilarly, fluids have weight, and they also Fig. 9.4\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 108water on the bottle is greater than its weight.\nTherefore it rises up when released.\nTo keep the bottle completely immersed,\nthe upwar d force on the bottle due to water\nmust be balanced. This can be achieved by\nan exter nally applied force acting downwar ds.\nThis for ce must at least be equal to the\ndifference between the upwar d force and the\nweight of the bottle.\nThe upwar d force exerted by the water on\nthe bottle is known as upthrust or buoyant\nforce. In fact, all objects experience a for ce of\nbuoyancy when they ar e immersed in a fluid.\nThe magnitude of this buoyant for ce depends\non the density of the fluid.\n9.5.3 WHY OBJECTS  FLOAT  OR SINK\nWHEN  PLACED  ON\n THE SURFACE  OF\nWATER ?\nLet us do the following activities to arrive at\nan answer for the above question.\nActivity ______________ 9.5\n\u2022Take a beaker filled with water .\n\u2022Take an ir on nail and place it on the\nsurface of the water .\n\u2022Observe what happens.\nThe nail sinks. The for ce due to the\ngravitational attraction of the earth on the\niron nail pulls it downwar ds. Ther e is an\nupthrust of water on the nail, which pushes\nit upwards. But the downwar d force acting\non the nail is greater than the upthrust of\nwater on the nail. So it sinks (Fig. 9.5).exert pressure on the base and walls of the\ncontainer in which they are enclosed. Pressure\nexerted in any confined mass of fluid is\ntransmitted undiminished in all directions.\n9.5.2 BUOYANCY\nHave you ever had a swim in a pool and felt\nlighter? Have you ever drawn water fr om a\nwell and felt that the bucket of water is heavier\nwhen it is out of the water? Have you ever\nwonder ed why a ship made of iron and steel\ndoes not sink in sea water , but while the same\namount of ir on and steel in the for m of a sheet\nwould sink? These questions can be answer ed\nby taking buoyancy in consideration. Let us\nunderstand the meaning of buoyancy by\ndoing an activity.\nActivity ______________ 9.4\n\u2022Take an empty plastic bottle. Close\nthe mouth of the bottle with an\nairtight stopper . Put it in a bucket\nfilled with water . You see that the\nbottle floats.\n\u2022Push the bottle into the water . You feel\nan upwar d push. T ry to push it further\ndown. Y ou will find it dif ficult to push\ndeeper and deeper . This indicates that\nwater exerts a for ce on the bottle in the\nupwar d dir ection. The upwar d for ce\nexerted by the water goes on incr easing\nas the bottle is pushed deeper  till it is\ncompletely immersed.\n\u2022Now, r elease the  bottle. It bounces\nback to the sur face.\n\u2022Does the for ce due to the gravitational\nattraction of the earth act on this\nbottle? If so, why doesn\u2019t the bottle stay\nimmersed in water after it is r eleased?\nHow can you immerse the bottle in\nwater?\nThe for ce due to the gravitational\nattraction of the earth acts on the bottle in\nthe downwar d dir ection. So the bottle is\npulled downwar ds. But the water exerts an\nupward force on the bottle. Thus, the bottle is\npushed upwards. W e have lear nt that weight\nof an object is the force due to gravitational\nattraction of the earth. When the bottle is\nimmersed, the upward force exerted by theFig. 9.5: An iron nail sinks and a cork floats when\nplaced on the sur face of water .\n2024-25\n\nGRAVITATION 109\u2022Observe what happens to  elongation\nof the string or the r eading on the\nbalance.\nYou will find that the elongation of the string\nor the reading of the balance decreases as the\nstone is gradually lower ed in the water . However ,\nno further change is observed once the stone\ngets fully immersed in the water . What do you\ninfer from the decrease in the extension of the\nstring or the reading of the spring balance?\nWe know that the elongation pr oduced in\nthe string or the spring balance is due to the\nweight of the stone. Since the extension\ndecreases once the stone is lower ed in water ,\nit means that some force acts on the stone in\nupward direction. As a result, the net force on\nthe string decreases and hence the elongation\nalso decr eases. As discussed earlier , this\nupward force exerted by water is known as\nthe force of buoyancy.\nWhat is the magnitude of the buoyant\nforce experienced by a body? Is it the same\nin all fluids for a given body? Do all bodies\nin a given fluid experience the same buoyant\nforce? The answer to these questions is\ncontained in Archimedes\u2019 principle, stated as\nfollows:Activity ______________ 9.6\n\u2022Take a beaker filled with water .\n\u2022Take a piece of cork and an ir on nail of\nequal mass.\n\u2022Place them on the sur face of water .\n\u2022Observe what happens.\nThe cork floats while the nail sinks. This\nhappens because of the dif ference in their\ndensities. The density of a substance is\ndefined as the mass per unit volume. The\ndensity of cork is less than the density of\nwater . This means that the upthrust of water\non the cork is gr eater than the weight of the\ncork. So it floats (Fig. 9.5).\nThe density of an iron nail is more than\nthe density of water . This means that the\nupthrust of water on the ir on nail is less than\nthe weight of the nail. So it sinks.\nTherefore objects of density less than that\nof a liquid float on the liquid. The objects of\ndensity gr eater than that of a liquid sink in\nthe liquid.\nuestions\n1.Why is it dif ficult to hold a school\nbag having a strap made of a thin\nand str ong string?\n2.What do you mean by buoyancy?\n3.Why does an object float or sink\nwhen placed on the sur face of\nwater?\n9.6Archimedes\u2019 Principle\nActivity ______________ 9.7\n\u2022Take a piece of stone and tie it to one\nend of a rubber string or a spring\nbalance.\n\u2022Suspend the stone by holding the\nbalance or the string as shown in\nFig. 9.6 (a).\n\u2022 Note the elongation of the string or\nthe reading on the spring balance due\nto the weight of the stone.\n\u2022Now, slowly dip the stone in the water\nin a container as shown in\nFig. 9.6 (b).\nFig. 9.6: (a) Observe the elongation of the rubber\nstring due to the weight of a piece of stone\nsuspended fr om it in air . (b) The elongation\ndecreases as the stone is immersed\nin water .(a)\n(b)\nQ\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 110What\nyou have\nlearnt\n\u2022 The law of gravitation states that the force of attraction\nbetween any two objects is proportional to the product of\ntheir masses and inversely proportional to the square of\nthe distance between them.  The law applies to objects\nanywhere in the universe.  Such a law is said to be universal.\n\u2022 Gravitation is a weak force unless large masses are involved.\n\u2022 The force of gravity decreases with altitude. It also varies\non the surface of the earth, decreasing from poles to the\nequator .\n\u2022 The weight of a body is the for ce with which the earth\nattracts it.\n\u2022 The weight is equal to the pr oduct of mass and acceleration\ndue to gravity.\n\u2022 The weight may vary from place to place but the mass stays\nconstant.When a body is immersed fully or partially\nin a fluid, it experiences an upward force that\nis equal to the weight of the fluid displaced\nby it.\nNow, can you explain why a further\ndecrease in the elongation of the string was\nnot observed in activity 9.7, as the stone was\nfully immersed in water?\nArchimedes was a Greek scientist. He\ndiscovered the principle, subsequently named\nafter him, after noticing that\nthe water in a bathtub\noverflowed when he stepped\ninto it. He ran through the\nstreets shouting \u201cEureka!\u201d,\nwhich means \u201cI have got it\u201d.\nThis knowledge helped him to\ndetermine the purity of the\ngold in the crown made for\nthe king.\nHis work in the field of Geometry and\nMechanics made him famous. His\nunderstanding of levers, pulleys, wheels-\nand-axle helped the Greek army in its war\nwith Roman army.\nArchimedesQArchimedes\u2019 principle has many\napplications. It is used in designing ships and\nsubmarines. Lactometers, which are used to\ndetermine the purity of a sample of milk and\nhydrometers used for determining density of\nliquids, are based on this principle.\nuestions\n1.You find your mass to be 42 kg\non a weighing machine.

The idea of divisibility\nof matter was considered long back in India,\naround 500 BC. An Indian philosopher\nMaharishi Kanad, postulated that if we go on\ndividing matter ( padarth ), we shall get smaller\nand smaller particles. Ultimately, a stage will\ncome when we shall come across the smallest\nparticles beyond which further division will\nnot be possible.  He named these particles\nParmanu . Another Indian philosopher ,\nPakudha Katyayama, elaborated this doctrine\nand said that these particles nor mally exist\nin a combined for m which gives us various\nforms of matter .\nAround the same era, ancient Gr eek\nphilosophers \u2013 Democritus and Leucippus\nsuggested that if we go on dividing matter , a\nstage will come when particles obtained\ncannot be divided further . Democritus called\nthese indivisible particles atoms (meaning\nindivisible). All this was based on\nphilosophical considerations and not much\nexperimental work to validate these ideas\ncould be done till the eighteenth century.\nBy the end of the eighteenth century,\nscientists recognised the dif ference between\nelements and compounds and naturally\nbecame inter ested in finding out how and why\nelements combine and what happens when\nthey combine.\nAntoine L. Lavoisier laid the foundation\nof chemical sciences by establishing two\nimportant laws of chemical combination.\n3.1Laws of Chemical Combination\nThe following two laws of chemical\ncombination were established aftermuch experimentations by Lavoisier and\nJoseph L. Proust.\n3.1.1 LAW\n OF CONSERVATION  OF MASS\nIs there a change in mass when a chemical\nchange (chemical reaction) takes place?\nActivity ______________ 3.1\n\u2022Take one of the following sets, X and Y\nof chemicals\u2014\nX Y\n(i)copper sulphate sodium carbonate\n(ii)barium chloride sodium sulphate\n(iii) lead nitrate sodium chloride\n\u2022Prepare separately a 5% solution of\nany one pair of substances listed\nunder X and Y each in 10 mL in water .\n\u2022Take a little amount of solution of Y in\na conical flask and some solution of\nX in an ignition tube.\n\u2022Hang the ignition tube in the flask\ncarefully; see that the solutions do not\nget mixed. Put a cork on the flask\n(see Fig. 3.1).\nFig. 3.1:  Ignition tube containing solution of X, dipped\nin a conical flask containing solution of Y3\nA AA AATOMSTOMSTOMS\nTOMSTOMS     AND ANDAND ANDAND M  M M  M MOLECULESOLECULESOLECULESOLECULESOLECULESChapter\n2024-25\n\nATOMS AND MOLECULES 27\u2022Weigh the flask with its contents\ncarefully.\n\u2022Now tilt and swirl the flask, so that the\nsolutions X and Y get mixed.\n\u2022Weigh again.\n\u2022What happens in the reaction flask?\n\u2022Do you think that a chemical reaction\nhas taken place?\n\u2022Why should we put a cork on the mouth\nof the flask?\n\u2022Does the mass of the flask and its\ncontents change?\nLaw of conservation of mass states that\nmass can neither be created nor destroyed in\na chemical reaction.\n3.1.2 LAW OF\n CONSTANT  PROPORTIONS\nLavoisier , along with other scientists, noted\nthat many compounds were composed of two\nor more elements and each such compound\nhad the same elements in the same\nproportions, irrespective of where the\ncompound came from or who prepared it.\nIn a compound such as water , the ratio of\nthe mass of hydrogen to the mass of oxygen is\nalways 1:8, whatever the sour ce of water . Thus,\nif 9 g of water is decomposed, 1 g of hydrogen\nand 8 g of oxygen are always obtained.\nSimilarly in ammonia, nitrogen and hydrogen\nare always present in the ratio 14:3 by mass,\nwhatever the method or the source from which\nit is obtained.\nThis led to the law of constant proportions\nwhich is also known as the law of definite\nproportions. This law was stated by Proust as\n\u201cIn a chemical substance the elements are\nalways present in definite proportions by\nmass \u201d.\nThe next problem faced by scientists was\nto give appropriate explanations of these laws.\nBritish chemist John Dalton provided the\nbasic theory about the natur e of matter .\nDalton picked up the idea of divisibility of\nmatter , which was till then just a philosophy.\nHe took the name \u2018atoms\u2019 as given by the\nGreeks and said that the smallest particles of\nmatter are atoms. His theory was based on the\nlaws of chemical combination. Dalton\u2019s atomic\ntheory provided an explanation for the law ofconservation of mass and the law of\ndefinite proportions.\nJohn Dalton was born in\na poor weaver\u2019s family in\n1766 in England. He\nbegan his car eer as a\nteacher at the age of\ntwelve. Seven years later\nhe became a school\nprincipal. In 1793, Dalton\nleft for Manchester to\nteach mathematics,\nphysics and chemistry in\na college. He spent most of his life there\nteaching and researching. In 1808, he\npresented his atomic theory which was a\nturning point in the study of matter .\nAccording to Dalton\u2019s atomic theory, all\nmatter , whether an element, a compound or\na mixtur e is composed of small particles called\natoms. The postulates of this theory may be\nstated as follows:\n(i)All matter is made of very tiny particles\ncalled atoms, which participate in\nchemical reactions.\n(ii)Atoms are indivisible particles, which\ncannot be cr eated or destr oyed in a\nchemical r eaction.\n(iii) Atoms of a given element ar e identical\nin mass and chemical pr operties.\n(iv)Atoms of dif ferent elements have\ndifferent masses and chemical\nproperties.\n(v)Atoms combine in the ratio of small\nwhole numbers to for m compounds.\n(vi)The r elative number and kinds of\natoms are constant in a given\ncompound.\nYou will study in the next chapter that all\natoms are made up of still smaller particles.\n uestions\n1.In a r eaction, 5.3 g of sodium\ncarbonate reacted with 6 g of\nacetic acid.

What\nis the building block of the huge building?\nWhat about the building block of an ant-hill?\nIt is a small grain of sand. Similarly, the\nbuilding blocks of all matter are atoms.\nHow big are atoms?\nAtoms are very small, they are smaller than\nanything that we can imagine or compar e\nwith.

Berzilius\nsuggested that the symbols of elements be\nmade from one or two letters of the name of\nthe element.\nFig. 3.3: Symbols for some elements as pr oposed by\nDalton\n2024-25\n\nATOMS AND MOLECULES 29In the beginning, the names of elements\nwere derived from the name of the place\nwhere they were found for the first time. For\nexample, the name copper was taken from\nCyprus. Some names were taken from\nspecific colours. For example, gold was taken\nfrom the English word meaning yellow.\nNow-a-days, IUPAC (International Union of\nPure and Applied Chemistry) is an\ninternational scientific organisation which\napproves names of elements, symbols and\nunits. Many of the symbols are the first one\nor two letters of the element\u2019s name in\nEnglish. The first letter of a symbol is always\nwritten as a capital letter (uppercase) and the\nsecond letter as a small letter (lowercase).\nFor example\n(i)hydrogen, H\n(ii)aluminium, Al and not AL\n(iii)cobalt, Co and not CO.\nSymbols of some elements are formed from\nthe first letter of the name and a letter ,\nappearing later in the name. Examples are: (i)\nchlorine, Cl, (ii) zinc, Zn etc.\nOther symbols have been taken from the\nnames of elements in Latin, German or Greek.\nFor example, the symbol of iron is Fe from its\nLatin name ferrum, sodium is Na from natrium,\npotassium is K from kalium. Therefore, each\nelement has a name and a unique\nchemical symbol.\n(The above table is given for you to refer to\nwhenever you study about elements. Do not\nbother to memorise all in one go. With thepassage of time and repeated usage you will\nautomatically be able to reproduce\nthe symbols).\n3.2.2 ATOMIC MASS\nThe most remarkable concept that Dalton\u2019s\natomic theory proposed was that of the atomic\nmass. According to him, each element had a\ncharacteristic atomic mass. The theory could\nexplain the law of constant proportions so well\nthat scientists were prompted to measure the\natomic mass of an atom. Since determining the\nmass of an individual atom was a relatively\ndifficult task, relative atomic masses were\ndetermined using the laws of chemical\ncombinations and the compounds formed.\nLet us take the example of a compound,\ncarbon monoxide (CO) formed by carbon and\noxygen. It was observed experimentally that 3\ng of carbon combines with 4 g of oxygen to\nform CO. In other words, carbon combines\nwith 4/3 times its mass of oxygen. Suppose\nwe define the atomic mass unit (earlier\nabbreviated as \u2018amu\u2019, but according to the\nlatest IUPAC recommendations, it is now\nwritten as \u2018u\u2019 \u2013 unified mass) as equal to the\nmass of one carbon atom, then we would\nassign carbon an atomic mass of 1.0 u and\noxygen an atomic mass of 1.33 u. However , it\nis more convenient to have these numbers asTable 3.1: Symbols for some elements\nElement Symbol Element Symbol Element Symbol\nAluminium Al Copper Cu Nitrogen N\nArgon Ar Fluorine F Oxygen O\nBarium Ba Gold Au Potassium K\nBoron B Hydrogen H Silicon Si\nBromine Br Iodine I Silver Ag\nCalcium Ca Iron Fe Sodium Na\nCarbon C Lead Pb Sulphur S\nChlorine Cl Magnesium Mg Uranium U\nCobalt Co Neon Ne Zinc Zn\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 30whole numbers or as near to a whole numbers\nas possible. While sear ching for various\natomic mass units, scientists initially took 1/\n16 of the mass of an atom of naturally\noccurring oxygen as the unit. This was\nconsider ed relevant due to two r easons:\n\u2022oxygen reacted with a lar ge number of\nelements and for med compounds.\n\u2022this atomic mass unit gave masses of\nmost of the elements as whole numbers.\nHowever , in 1961 for a universally\naccepted atomic mass unit, carbon-12 isotope\nwas chosen as the standar d reference for\nmeasuring atomic masses. One atomic mass\nunit is a mass unit equal to exactly one-twelfth\n(1/12th) the mass of one atom of carbon-12.\nThe r elative atomic masses of all elements\nhave been found with r espect to an atom of\ncarbon-12.\nImagine a fruit seller selling fruits without\nany standard weight with him. He takes a\nwater melon and says, \u201cthis has a mass equal\nto 12 units\u201d (12 water melon units or 12 fruit\nmass units). He makes twelve equal pieces of\nthe watermelon and finds the mass of each fruit\nhe is selling, relative to the mass of one piece\nof the watermelon. Now he sells his fruits by\nrelative fruit mass unit (fmu), as in Fig. 3.4.\nFig. 3.4 : (a) W atermelon, (b) 12 pieces, (c) 1/12 of\nwatermelon, (d) how the fruit seller can\nweigh the fruits using pieces of watermelon\nSimilarly, the relative atomic mass of the\natom of an element is defined as the averagemass of the atom, as compared to 1/12th the\nmass of one carbon-12 atom.\nTable 3.2: Atomic masses of\na few elements\nElement Atomic Mass (u)\nHydrogen 1\nCarbon 12\nNitrogen 14\nOxygen 16\nSodium 23\nMagnesium 24\nSulphur 32\nChlorine 35.5\nCalcium 40\n3.2.3 HOW DO ATOMS EXIST ?\nAtoms of most elements are not able to exist\nindependently.

A molecule can be defined\nas the smallest particle of an element or a\ncompound that is capable of an independent\nexistence and shows all the properties of that\nsubstance. Atoms of the same element or of\ndifferent elements can join together to form\nmolecules.Q\n2024-25\n\nATOMS AND MOLECULES 313.3.1 MOLECULES OF ELEMENTS\nThe molecules of an element are constituted\nby the same type of atoms. Molecules of many\nelements, such as ar gon (Ar), helium (He) etc.\nare made up of only one atom of that element.\nBut this is not the case with most of the non-\nmetals. For example, a molecule of oxygen\nconsists of two atoms of oxygen and hence it\nis known as a diatomic molecule, O2. If 3\natoms of oxygen unite into a molecule, instead\nof the usual 2, we get ozone, O3. The number\nof atoms constituting a molecule is known as\nits atomicity.\nMetals and some other elements, such as\ncarbon, do not have a simple structur e but\nconsist of a very lar ge and indefinite number\nof atoms bonded together .\nLet us look at the atomicity of some\nnon-metals.\nTable 3.3 : Atomicity of some\nelements\nType of Name Atomicity\nElement\nNon-Metal Argon Monoatomic\nHelium Monoatomic\nOxygen Diatomic\nHydrogen Diatomic\nNitrogen Diatomic\nChlorine Diatomic\nPhosphorus Tetra-atomic\nSulphur Poly-atomicTable 3.4 : Molecules of some\ncompounds\nCompound Combining Ratio\nElements   by\nMass\nWater (H2O) Hydrogen, Oxygen 1:8\nAmmonia (NH3)Nitrogen, Hydrogen 14:3\nCarbon\ndioxide (CO2)Carbon, Oxygen 3:8\nActivity ______________ 3.2\n\u2022Refer to Table 3.4 for ratio by mass of\natoms pr esent in molecules and T able\n3.2 for atomic masses of elements. Find\nthe ratio by number of the atoms of\nelements in the molecules of\ncompounds given in T able 3.4.\n\u2022The ratio by number of atoms for a\nwater molecule can be found as follows:\nElement Ratio Atomic Mass Simplest\nby mass ratio/ ratio\nmass (u) atomic\nmass\nH 1 11\n1=1 2\nO 8 168\n16=1\n21\n\u2022Thus, the ratio by number of atoms for\nwater is H:O = 2:1.\n3.3.3 WHAT IS AN ION?\nCompounds composed of metals and non-\nmetals contain char ged species. The charged\nspecies are known as ions. Ions may consist\nof a single charged atom or a group of atoms\nthat have a net charge on them. An ion can be\nnegatively or positively charged. A negatively\ncharged ion is called an \u2018anion\u2019 and the\npositively charged ion, a \u2018cation\u2019. Take, for\nexample, sodium chloride (NaCl). Its\nconstituent particles are positively charged\nsodium ions (Na+) and negatively charged3.3.2 MOLECULES\n OF COMPOUNDS\nAtoms of different elements join together\nin definite proportions to form molecules\nof compounds.

V alency can\nbe used to find out how the atoms of an\nelement will combine with the atom(s) of\nanother element to form a chemical compound.\nThe valency of the atom of an element can be\nthought of as hands or arms of that atom.\nHuman beings have two arms and an\noctopus has eight. If one octopus has to catch\nhold of a few people in such a manner that all\nthe eight arms of the octopus and both arms\nof all the humans are locked, how many\nhumans do you think the octopus can hold?\nRepresent the octopus with O and humans\nwith H. Can you write a formula for this\ncombination? Do you get OH4 as the formula?\nThe subscript 4 indicates the number of\nhumans held by the octopus.\nThe valencies of some common ions are\ngiven in T able 3.6. W e will lear n mor e about\nvalency in the next chapter .\n* Some elements show mor e than one valency.

Then their char ges ar e\ncriss-crossed to get the for mula.\n4. For mula of magnesium chloride\nFormula : MgCl2\nThus, in magnesium chloride, there ar e\ntwo chloride ions (Cl-) for each magnesium\nion (Mg2+).

For example: calcium\noxide (CaO), sodium chloride (NaCl), iron\nsulphide (FeS), copper oxide (CuO), etc.,\nwhere oxygen, chlorine, sulphur are non-\nmetals  and are written on the right,\nwhereas calcium, sodium, iron and\ncopper are metals, and are written on\nthe left.\n\u2022in compounds formed with polyatomic ions,\nthe number of ions present in the\ncompound is indicated by enclosing the\nformula of ion in a bracket and writing the\nnumber of ions outside the bracket. For\nexample, Mg (OH)2. In case the number of\npolyatomic ion is one, the bracket is not\nrequired. For example, NaOH.\n3.4.1 FORMULAE  OF SIMPLE  COMPOUNDS\nThe simplest compounds, which are made up\nof two different elements are called binary\ncompounds.

This is known\nas the Law of Conservation of Mass.\n\u2022 In a pure chemical compound, elements are always present\nin a definite proportion by mass. This is known as the Law\nof Definite Proportions.\n\u2022 An atom is the smallest particle of the element that cannot\nusually exist independently and retain all its chemical\nproperties.\n\u2022 A molecule is the smallest particle of an element or a\ncompound capable of independent existence under ordinary\nconditions.

For example, in Amoeba, a single\ncell carries out movement, intake of food,\ngaseous exchange and excretion. But in multi-\ncellular organisms there are millions of cells.\nMost of these cells are specialised to carry out\nspecific functions. Each specialised function\nis taken up by a different group of cells. Since\nthese cells carry out only a particular function,\nthey do it very efficiently. In human beings,\nmuscle cells contract and relax to cause\nmovement, nerve cells carry messages, blood\nflows to transport oxygen, food, hormones and\nwaste material and so on. In plants, vascular\ntissues conduct food and water from one part\nof the plant to other parts. So, multi-cellular\norganisms show division of labour . Cells\nspecialising in one function are often grouped\ntogether in the body. This means that a\nparticular function is carried out by a cluster\nof cells at a definite place in the body. This\ncluster of cells, called a tissue, is arranged and\ndesigned so as to give the highest possible\nefficiency of function. Blood, phloem and\nmuscle are all examples of tissues.\nA group of cells that are similar in structure\nand/or work together to achieve a particular\nfunction forms a tissue.\n6.1Are Plants and Animals Made\nof Same Types of Tissues?\nLet us compar e their structur e and functions.\nDo plants and animals have the same\nstructur e? Do they both per form similar\nfunctions?There are noticeable differences between\nthe two. Plants are stationary or fixed \u2013 they\ndon\u2019t move. Since they have to be upright, they\nhave a large quantity of supportive tissue. The\nsupportive tissue generally has dead cells.\nAnimals on the other hand move around\nin sear ch of food, mates and shelter . They\nconsume more energy as compared to plants.\nMost of the tissues they contain are living.\nAnother difference between animals and\nplants is in the pattern of growth. The growth\nin plants is limited to certain regions, while this\nis not so in animals. There are some tissues in\nplants that divide throughout their life. These\ntissues are localised in certain regions. Based\non the dividing capacity of the tissues, various\nplant tissues can be classified as growing or\nmeristematic tissue and permanent tissue. Cell\ngrowth in animals is more uniform. So, there\nis no such demarcation of dividing and non-\ndividing regions in animals.\nThe structural organisation of organs and\norgan systems is far more specialised and\nlocalised in complex animals than even in very\ncomplex plants. This fundamental difference\nreflects the different modes of life pursued by\nthese two major groups of organisms,\nparticularly in their different feeding methods.\nAlso, they are differently adapted for a\nsedentary existence on one hand (plants) and\nactive locomotion on the other (animals),\ncontributing to this difference in organ system\ndesign.\nIt is with reference to these complex animal\nand plant bodies that we will now talk about\nthe concept of tissues in some detail.6\nT TTTTISSUES\nISSUESISSUES ISSUESISSUESChapter\n2024-25\n\nLateral meristemuestions\n1.What is a tissue?\n2.What is the utility of tissues in\nmulti-cellular organisms?\n6.2Plant Tissues\n6.2.1 MERISTEMATIC TISSUE\u2022From the above observations, answer\nthe following questions:\n1.Which of the two onions has longer\nroots? Why?\n2.Do the roots continue growing\neven after we have removed their\ntips?\n3.Why would the tips stop growing\nin jar 2 after we cut them?\nThe growth of plants occurs only in certain\nspecific regions. This is because the dividing\ntissue, also known as meristematic tissue, is\nlocated only at these points. Depending on\nthe r egion where they are pr esent,\nmeristematic tissues ar e classified as apical,\nlateral and inter calary (Fig. 6.2). New cells\nproduced by meristem are initially like those\nof meristem itself, but as they grow and\nmature, their characteristics slowly change and\nthey become differentiated as components of\nother tissues.\nFig. 6.1:  Growth of r oots in onion bulbs\nActivity ______________ 6.1\n\u2022Take two glass jars and fill them with\nwater .\n\u2022Now, take two onion bulbs and place\none on each jar , as shown in\nFig. 6.1.\n\u2022Observe the growth of roots in both\nthe bulbs for a few days.\n\u2022Measure the length of roots on day 1,\n2 and 3.\n\u2022On day 4, cut the r oot tips of the onion\nbulb in jar 2 by about 1 cm.

The girth of\nthe stem or root increases due to lateral\nmeristem (cambium). Intercalary meristem\nseen in some plants is located near the node.Fig. 6.2:  Location of meristematic tissue in plant bodyJar 1 Jar 2\nTISSUES 61Apical meristem\nIntercalary meristem\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 62\nCuticle\nEpider mis\nCollenchyma\nParenchyma\nPhloem\nVascular bundleXylem\nFig. 6.3: Section of a stemCells of meristematic tissue are very active,\nthey have dense cytoplasm, thin cellulose walls\nand prominent nuclei. They lack vacuoles. Can\nwe think why they would lack vacuoles? (Y ou\nmight want to refer to the functions of vacuoles\nin the chapter on cells.)\n6.2.2 PERMANENT TISSUE\nWhat happens to the cells formed by\nmeristematic tissue? They take up a specific\nrole and lose the ability to divide. As a r esult,\nthey for m a per manent tissue. This pr ocess\nof taking up a per manent shape, size, and  a\nfunction is called differentiation. Differentiation\nleads to the development of various types of\npermanent tissues.3.Can we think of reasons why there\nwould be so many types of cells?\n\u2022We can also try to cut sections of plant\nroots. W e can even try cutting sections\nof root and stem of dif ferent plants.\n6.2.2 ( i) SIMPLE PERMANENT  TISSUE\nA few layers of cells beneath the epidermis are\ngenerally simple permanent tissue.\nParenchyma is the most common simple\npermanent tissue. It consists of relatively\nunspecialised cells with thin cell walls. They\nare living cells. They are usually loosely\narranged, thus large spaces between cells\n(intercellular  spaces) are found in this tissue\n(Fig. 6.4  a). This tissue generally stores food.\nActivity ______________ 6.2\n\u2022Take a plant stem and  with the help\nof your teacher cut into very thin slices\nor sections.\n\u2022Now, stain the slices with safranin.\nPlace one neatly cut section on a slide,\nand put a dr op of glycerine.\n\u2022Cover with a cover -slip and observe\nunder a micr oscope. Observe the\nvarious types of cells and their\narrangement. Compare it with Fig. 6.3.\n\u2022Now, answer the following on the\nbasis of your observation:\n1.Are all cells similar in structure?\n2.How many types of cells can\nbe seen?In some situations, it contains chlorophyll and\nperforms photosynthesis, and then it is called\nchlorenchyma. In aquatic plants, large air\ncavities are present in parenchyma to help\nthem float. Such a parenchyma type is called\naerenchyma.\nThe flexibility in plants is due to another\npermanent tissue, collenchyma. It allows\nbending of various parts of a plant  like tendrils\nand stems of climbers without breaking. It\nalso pr ovides mechanical support. W e can find\nthis tissue in leaf stalks below the epidermis.\nThe cells of this tissue are living, elongated\nand irregularly thickened at the\ncorners. There is very little intercellular space\n(Fig. 6.4 b).\n2024-25\n\nTISSUES 63Fig. 6.4: Various types of simple tissues: (a) Par enchyma (b) Collenchyma (c) Scler enchyma (i) transverse section,\n(ii) longitudinal section.\nYet another type of per manent tissue is\nsclerenchyma. It is the tissue which makes the\nplant har d and stif f. We have seen the husk of\na coconut. It is made of sclerenchymatous\ntissue. The cells of this tissue are dead. They\nare long and narrow as the walls are thickened\ndue to lignin. Often these walls are so thick\nthat there is no internal space inside the cell\n(Fig. 6.4 c). This tissue is present in stems,\naround vascular bundles, in the veins of leaves\nand in the hard covering of seeds and nuts. It\nprovides strength to the plant parts.\nActivity ______________ 6.3\n\u2022Take a freshly plucked leaf of Rhoeo.\n\u2022Stretch and break it by applying\npressure.\n\u2022While breaking it, keep it stretched\ngently so that some peel or skin\nprojects out from the cut.\n\u2022Remove this peel and put it in a petri\ndish filled with water .\n\u2022Add a few drops of safranin.\n\u2022Wait for a couple of minutes and then\ntransfer it onto a slide. Gently place\na cover slip over it.\n\u2022Observe under microscope.\nWhat you observe is the outermost layer\nof cells, called epidermis. The epidermis is\nusually made of a single layer of cells. In some\nplants living in very dry habitats, the epidermis\nmay be thicker since protection against water\nloss is critical. The entire surface of a plant has\nan outer covering epidermis. It protects all the\nparts of the plant.

This aids\nin protection against loss of water , mechanical\ninjury and invasion by parasitic fungi. Since\nit has a protective role to play, cells of\nepidermal  tissue form a continuous layer\nwithout intercellular spaces. Most epidermal\ncells are relatively flat. Often their outer and\nside walls are thicker than the inner wall.\nWe can observe small por es her e and\nthere in the epidermis of the leaf. These pores\nare called stomata (Fig. 6.5). Stomata are\nenclosed by two kidney-shaped cells\ncalled guard cells. They are necessary for\nexchanging gases with the atmosphere.\nTranspiration (loss of water in the for m of\nwater vapour) also takes place\nthrough stomata.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 64Recall which gas is required for\nphotosynthesis.\nFind out the role of transpiration in plants.\nEpidermal cells of the roots, whose function\nis water absorption, commonly bear long hair -\nlike parts that greatly increase the total\nabsorptive surface area.\nIn some plants like desert plants,\nepider mis has a thick waxy coating of cutin\n(chemical substance with waterpr oof quality)\non its outer sur face. Can we think of a r eason\nfor this?\nIs the outer layer of a branch of a tr ee\ndifferent fr om the outer layer of a young stem?\nAs plants gr ow older , the outer pr otective\ntissue undergoes certain changes. A strip of\nsecondary meristem located in the cortex forms\nlayers of cells which constitute the cork. Cells\nof cork are dead and compactly arranged\nwithout intercellular spaces (Fig. 6.6). They\nalso have a substance called suberin in their\nwalls that makes them impervious to gases\nand water .is a distinctive feature of the complex plants,\none that has made possible their survival in\nthe terrestrial environment. In Fig. 6.3 showing\na section of stem, can you see different types\nof cells in the vascular bundle?\nXylem consists of tracheids, vessels, xylem\nparenchyma (Fig. 6.7 a,b,c) and xylem fibres.\nTracheids and vessels have thick walls, and\nmany ar e dead cells when mature. T racheids\nand vessels are tubular structures. This allows\nthem to transport water and minerals\nvertically. The parenchyma stores food. Xylem\nfibres are mainly supportive in function.\nPhloem is made up of five types of cells:\nsieve cells, sieve tubes, companion cells,\nphloem fibres and the phloem parenchyma\n[Fig. 6.7 (d)]. Sieve tubes are tubular cells with\nperforated walls. Phloem transports food from\nleaves to other parts of the plant. Except\nphloem fibres, other phloem cells are living cells.\n6.2.2 ( ii) COMPLEX  PERMANENT  TISSUE\nThe different types of tissues we have discussed\nuntil now are all made of one type of cells,\nwhich look like each other . Such tissues ar e\ncalled simple per manent tissue. Y et another\ntype of permanent tissue is complex tissue.\nComplex tissues are made of more than one\ntype of cells. All these cells coordinate to\nperform a common function. Xylem and\nphloem are examples of such complex tissues.\nThey are both conducting tissues and\nconstitute a vascular bundle.

How do these body\nparts move? For this we have specialised cells\ncalled muscle cells (Fig. 6.8). The contraction\nand relaxation of these cells result\nin movement.Q\nFig. 6.8:  Location of muscle fibres\nSmooth muscle fibres\nSmooth muscle fibre\n(Cell)NucleusDuring breathing we inhale oxygen. Where\ndoes this oxygen go? It is absorbed in the lungs\nand then is transported to all the body cells\nthrough blood. Why would cells need oxygen?\nThe functions of mitochondria we studied\nearlier provide a clue to this question. Blood\nflows and carries various substances from one\npart of the body to the other . For example, it\ncarries oxygen and food to all cells. It also\ncollects wastes from all parts of the body and\ncarries them to the liver and kidney for\ndisposal.\nBlood and muscles are both examples of\ntissues found in our body. On the basis of  the\nfunctions they perform we can think of different\ntypes of animal tissues, such as epithelial\ntissue, connective tissue, muscular tissue and\nnervous tissue. Blood is a type of connective\ntissue, and muscle forms muscular tissue.\n6.3.1 EPITHELIAL  TISSUE\nThe covering or protective tissues in the animal\nbody are epithelial tissues. Epithelium covers\nmost organs and cavities within the body. It\nalso forms a barrier to keep different body\nsystems separate. The skin, the lining of the\nmouth, the lining of blood vessels, lung alveoli\nand kidney tubules are all made of epithelial\ntissue. Epithelial tissue cells are tightly packed\nand form a continuous sheet. They have only\na small amount of cementing material between\nthem and almost no intercellular spaces.\nObviously, anything entering or leaving the\nbody must cross at least one layer of\nepithelium. As a result, the permeability of the\ncells of various epithelia play an important role\nin regulating the exchange of materials\nbetween the body and the external\nenvironment and also between different parts\nof the body. Regardless of the type, all\nepithelium is usually separated from the\nunderlying tissue by an extracellular fibrous\nbasement membrane.\nDifferent epithelia (Fig. 6.9) show differing\nstructures that correlate with their unique\nfunctions. For example, in cells lining blood\nvessels or lung alveoli, where transportation\nof substances occurs through a selectively\npermeable surface, there is a simple flat kind\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 66Fig. 6.9: Different types of epithelial tissuesof skin). Simple squamous epithelial cells are\nextremely thin and flat and form a delicate\nlining. The oesophagus and the lining of the\nmouth are also covered with squamous\nepithelium. The skin, which protects the body,\nis also made of squamous epithelium. Skin\nepithelial cells are arranged in many layers to\nprevent wear and tear . Since they ar e arranged\nin a pattern of layers, the epithelium is called\nstratified squamous epithelium.\nWher e absorption and secr etion occur , as\nin the inner lining of the intestine, tall epithelial\ncells are present. This columnar (meaning\n\u2018pillar -like\u2019) epithelium facilitates movement\nacross the epithelial barrier . In the r espiratory\ntract, the columnar epithelial tissue also has\ncilia, which ar e hair -like pr ojections on the\nouter surfaces of epithelial cells. These cilia can\nmove, and their movement pushes the mucus\nforward to clear it. This type of epithelium is\nthus ciliated columnar epithelium.\nCuboidal epithelium (with cube-shaped\ncells) forms the lining of kidney tubules and\nducts of salivary glands, where it provides\nmechanical support. Epithelial cells often\nacquire additional specialisation as gland cells,\nwhich can secrete substances at the epithelial\nsurface. Sometimes a portion of the epithelial\ntissue folds inward, and a multicellular gland\nis formed. This is glandular epithelium.\n6.3.2 CONNECTIVE  TISSUE\nBlood is a type of connective tissue. Why would\nit be called \u2018connective\u2019 tissue? A clue is\nprovided in the introduction of this chapter!\nNow, let us look at this type of tissue in some\nmore detail. The cells of connective tissue are\nloosely spaced and embedded in an\nintercellular matrix (Fig. 6.10). The matrix may\nbe jelly like, fluid, dense or rigid. The nature\nof matrix differs in concordance with the\nfunction of the particular connective tissue.\nActivity 6.4\nTake a drop of blood on a slide and\nobserve different cells present in it\nunder a microscope.of epithelium. This is called the simple\nsquamous epithelium (squama means scale\n(a) Squamous\n(b) Stratified squamous\n(c) Cuboidal\n(d) Columnar (Ciliated)\n2024-25\n\nTISSUES 67Blood has a fluid (liquid) matrix called\nplasma, in which red blood corpuscles (RBCs),\nwhite blood corpuscles (WBCs) and platelets\nare suspended. The plasma contains proteins,\nsalts and hormones. Blood flows and\ntransports gases, digested food, hor mones\nand waste materials to different parts of\nthe body.\nBone is another example of a connective\ntissue. It forms the framework that supports\nthe body. It also anchors the muscles and\nsupports the main or gans of the body. It is a\nstrong and nonflexible tissue (what would be\nthe advantage of these pr operties for bone\nfunctions?). Bone cells ar e embedded in a\nhard matrix that is composed of calcium and\nphosphorus compounds.\nTwo bones can be connected to each other\nby another type of connective tissue called the\nligament. This tissue is very elastic. It has\nconsiderable str ength. Ligaments contain\nvery little matrix and connect bones with\nbones. Tendons connect muscles to bones and\nare another type of connective tissue. Tendons\nare fibrous tissue with great strength but\nlimited flexibility.\nAnother type of connective tissue,\ncartilage, has widely spaced cells. The solid\nmatrix is composed of proteins and sugars.\nCartilage smoothens bone surfaces at joints\nand is also present in the nose, ear , trachea\nand larynx. W e can fold the cartilage of the ears,\nbut we cannot bend the bones in our arms.\nThink of how  the two tissues are different!\nAreolar connective tissue is found between\nthe skin and muscles, ar ound blood vessels\nand nerves and in the bone marr ow. It fills\nthe space inside the or gans, supports inter nal\norgans and helps in r epair of tissues.\nWher e are fats stor ed in our body? Fat-\nstoring adipose tissue is found below the skin\nand between inter nal or gans. The cells of this\ntissue ar e filled with fat globules. Storage of\nfats also lets it act as an insulator .\n6.3.3 MUSCULAR  TISSUE\nMuscular tissue consists of elongated cells,\nalso called muscle fibres. This tissue is\nresponsible for movement in our body.Fig. 6.10:  Types of connective tissues: (a) types of blood\ncells, (b) compact bone, (c) hyaline cartilage,\n(d) areolar tissue, (e) adipose tissue\n(a)Different white\nblood corpusclesNeutrophil\n(polynuclear\nleucocyte)Basophil EosinophilNucleusCytoplasm\nLymphocyte Monocyte Platelets\nHaversian canal\n(contains blood vessels\nand nerve fibr es)\nCanaliculus (contains\nslender process of bone\ncell or osteocyte)Hyaline matrixChondrocyte\nRed blood\ncorpuscle(b)(c)\nReticular fibre Fibroblast\nMacrophage\nCollagen fibre\nMast cell Plasma cell\n(d)\nFat dropletNucleus\nAdipocyte\n(e)\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 68[Fig. 6.11(a)]. These muscles are also called\nskeletal muscles as they are mostly attached\nto bones and help in body movement. Under\nthe microscope, these muscles show alternate\nlight and dark bands or striations when\nstained appr opriately. As a result, they ar e\nalso called striated muscles. The cells of this\ntissue ar e long, cylindrical, unbranched and\nmultinucleate (having many nuclei).\nThe movement of food in the alimentary\ncanal or the contraction and relaxation of blood\nvessels ar e involuntary movements. W e cannot\nreally start them or stop them simply by\nwanting to do so! Smooth muscles [Fig.\n6.11(b)] or involuntary muscles contr ol such\nmovements. They ar e also found in the iris of\nthe eye, in ureters and in the bronchi of the\nlungs. The cells are long with pointed ends\n(spindle-shaped) and uninucleate (having a\nsingle nucleus). They are also called unstriated\nmuscles \u2013 why would they be called that?\nThe muscles of the heart show rhythmic\ncontraction and relaxation throughout life.\nThese involuntary muscles are called cardiac\nmuscles [Fig. 6.11(c)]. Heart muscle cells are\ncylindrical, branched and uninucleate.\nActivity 6.5\nCompare the structures of different\ntypes of muscular tissues.

However , cells of the nervous tissue\nare highly specialised for being stimulated andMuscles contain special proteins called\ncontractile proteins, which contract and relax\nto cause movement.\nFig. 6.11: Types of muscles fibres: (a) striated muscle,\n(b) smooth muscle, (c) cardiac muscle\nWe can move some muscles by conscious\nwill.

Nerve impulses allow\nus to move our muscles when we want to. The\nfunctional  combination of nerve and muscle\ntissue is fundamental to most animals. This\ncombination enables animals to move rapidly\nin response to stimuli.\nuestions\n1.Name the tissue responsible for\nmovement in our body.\n2.What does a neuron look like?\n3.Give three features of cardiac\nmuscles.\n4.What are the functions of\nareolar tissue?Q\nNucleus\nDendrite\nAxonNerve ending\nCell body\nFig. 6.12:  Neur on-unit of nervous tissuethen transmitting the stimulus very rapidly\nfrom one place to another within the body.

But, for a scientist all these things\nare actually mixtures of different substances\nand hence not pure. For example, milk is\nactually a mixtur e of water , fat, pr oteins, etc.\nWhen a scientist says that something is pure,\nit means that all the constituent particles of\nthat substance are the same in their chemical\nnature. A pure substance consists of a single\ntype of particle. In other words, a substance is\na pur e single for m of matter .\nAs we look around, we can see that most\nof the matter around us exists as mixtures of\ntwo or more pure components, for example,\nsea water , minerals, soil, etc., ar e all mixtur es.\n2.1 What is a Mixture?\nMixtures  are constituted by more than one\nkind of pure for m of matter . We know that\ndissolved sodium chloride can be separated\nfrom water by the physical process of\nevaporation. However , sodium chloride is itselfa pure substance and cannot be separated by\nphysical process into its chemical constituents.\nSimilarly, sugar is a substance which contains\nonly one kind of pure matter and its\ncomposition is the same throughout.\nSoft drink and soil are not single pure\nsubstances. Whatever the source of a\npure substance may be, it will always have\nthe same characteristic properties.\nTherefore, we can say that a mixture\ncontains more than one pure substance.\n2.1.1 TYPES OF MIXTURES\nDepending upon the nature of the components\nthat form a mixture, we can have different\ntypes of mixtures.\nActivity ______________ 2.1\n\u2022Let us divide the class into groups A,\nB, C and D.\n\u2022Group A takes a beaker containing\n50 mL of water and one spatula full\nof copper sulphate powder .

Such\nmixtures are called homogeneous\nmixtures or solutions. Some other\nexamples of such mixtures are: (i) salt\ndissolved in water and (ii) sugar\ndissolved in water . Compar e theHow do we judge whether milk, ghee, butter ,\nsalt, spices, mineral water or juice that we buy\nfrom the market are pure?2\nI II IISSS\nSS M  M M M MATTER ATTERATTER ATTERATTER A  A A  A AROUND ROUNDROUND ROUNDROUND  U  U U  U US SS SS P  P P  P PURE UREURE UREURE? ?? ??Chapter\n2024-25\n\nMore to  knowcolour of the solutions of the two\ngroups.

Such mixtures are called\nheterogeneous mixtures.

Are the particles\nin the mixture visible?\n\u2022Direct a beam of light from a torch\nthrough the beaker containing the\nmixtur e and observe fr om the fr ont. W as\nthe path of the beam of light visible?\n\u2022Leave the mixtures undisturbed for\na few minutes (and set up the\nfiltration apparatus in the meantime).\nIs the mixture stable or do the\nparticles begin to settle after some\ntime?\n\u2022Filter the mixture. Is there any\nresidue on the filter paper?\n\u2022Discuss the results and form an\nopinion.\nGroups A and B have got a solution.\nGroup C has got a suspension.\nGroup D has got a colloidal solution.Now, we shall learn about solutions,\nsuspensions and colloidal solutions in the\nfollowing sections.\nuestions\n1.What is meant by a substance?\n2.List the points of differences\nbetween homogeneous and\nheterogeneous mixtures.\n2.2What is a Solution?\nA solution is a homogeneous mixture of two\nor mor e substances. Y ou come acr oss various\ntypes of solutions in your daily life. Lemonade,\nsoda water , etc., ar e all examples of solutions.\nUsually we think of a solution as a liquid that\ncontains either a solid, liquid or a gas dissolved\nin it. But, we can also have solid solutions\n(alloys) and gaseous solutions (air). In a\nsolution there is homogeneity at the particle\nlevel. For example, lemonade tastes the same\nthroughout. This shows that particles of sugar\nor salt are evenly distributed in\nthe solution.Q\nFig. 2.2:  Filtration\nAlloys : Alloys are mixtures of two or\nmore metals or ametal and  a non-metal\nand cannot be separated into their\ncomponents by physical methods. But\nstill, an alloy is considered as a mixture\nbecause it shows the properties of its\nconstituents and can have variable\ncomposition. For example, brass is a\nmixture of approximately 30% zinc and\n70% copper .\nIS M ATTER AROUND  US PURE? 15\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 16A solution has a solvent and a solute as its\ncomponents.  The component of the solution\nthat dissolves the other component in it\n(usually the component present in larger\namount) is called the solvent.  The component\nof the solution that is dissolved in the solvent\n(usually present in lesser quantity) is called\nthe solute.\nExamples:\n(i)A solution of sugar in water is a  solid\nin liquid solution. In this solution,\nsugar is the solute and water is\nthe solvent.\n(ii)A solution of iodine in alcohol known\nas \u2018tincture of iodine\u2019, has iodine (solid)\nas the solute and alcohol (liquid) as the\nsolvent.\n(iii)Aerated drinks like soda water , etc., ar e\ngas in liquid solutions. These contain\ncarbon dioxide (gas) as solute and water\n(liquid) as solvent.\n(iv)Air is a mixture of gas in gas. Air is a\nhomogeneous mixture of a number of\ngases. Its two main constituents are:\noxygen (21%) and nitrogen (78%). The\nother gases are present in very\nsmall quantities.\nProperties of a Solution\n\u2022A solution is a homogeneous mixture.\n\u2022The particles of a solution are smaller\nthan 1 nm (10-9 metre) in diameter . So,\nthey cannot be seen by naked eyes.\n\u2022Because of very small particle size, they\ndo not scatter a beam of light passing\nthrough the solution. So, the path of\nlight is not visible in a solution.\n\u2022The solute particles cannot be separated\nfrom the mixture by the process of\nfiltration. The solute particles do not\nsettle down when left undisturbed , that\nis, a solution is stable.\n2.2.1 C ONCENTRATION  OF A SOLUTION\nIn activity 2.2, we observed that groups A and\nB obtained different shades of solutions. So,\nwe understand that in a solution the relativeproportion of the solute and solvent can be\nvaried. Depending upon the amount of solute\npresent in a solution, it can be called  dilute,\nconcentrated or  saturated solution. Dilute\nand concentrated are comparative terms. In\nactivity 2.2, the solution obtained by group\nA is dilute as compared to that obtained by\ngroup B.\nActivity ______________ 2.3\n\u2022Take approximately 50 mL of water\neach in two separate beakers.\n\u2022Add salt in one beaker and sugar or\nbarium chloride in the second beaker\nwith continuous stirring.\n\u2022When no more solute can be dissolved,\nheat the contents of the beaker to raise\nthe temperature by about 5oC.\u00b0\n\u2022Start adding the solute again.\nIs the amount of salt and sugar or barium\nchloride, that can be dissolved in water  at a\ngiven temperature, the same?\nAt any particular temperature, a solution\nthat has dissolved as much solute as it is\ncapable of dissolving, is said to be a saturated\nsolution. In other words, when no more solute\ncan be dissolved in a solution at a given\ntemperature, it is called a saturated solution.\nThe amount of the solute present in the\nsaturated solution at this temperature is called\nits solubility.\nIf the amount of solute contained in a\nsolution is less than the saturation level, it is\ncalled an unsaturated solution.\nWhat would happen if you were to take a\nsaturated solution at a certain temperature\nand cool it slowly.\nWe can infer from the above activity that\ndifferent substances in a given solvent have\ndifferent solubilities at the same temperature.\nThe concentration of a solution is the amount\n(mass or volume)  of solute present in a given\namount (mass or volume) of solution .\nThere are various ways of expressing the\nconcentration of a solution, but here we will\nlearn only three methods.\n(i)Mass by mass percentage of a solution\nMass of solute= \u00d7100\nMass of solution\n2024-25\n\nIS MATTER AROUND  US PURE? 17(ii)Mass by volume percentage of a solution\nMass of solute= \u00d7100\nVolume of solution\n(iii)Volume by volume per centage of a\nsolution\nVolume of solute= \u00d7100\nVolume of solution\nExample 2.1 A solution contains 40 g of\ncommon salt in 320 g of water . Calculate\nthe concentration in terms of mass by\nmass percentage of the solution.\nSolution:\nMass of solute (salt) =40 g\nMass of solvent (water) =320 g\nWe know,\nMass of solution = Mass of solute +\nMass of solvent\n= 40 g + 320 g\n= 360 g\nMass percentage of solution\nMass of solute= \u00d7100\nMassof solution\n                 40= \u00d7100 =11.1%\n360\n2.2.2 W HAT IS A SUSPENSION ?\nNon-homogeneous systems, like those\nobtained by group C in activity 2.2, in which\nsolids are dispersed in liquids, are called\nsuspensions. A suspension is a heterogeneous\nmixture in which the solute  particles do not\ndissolve but remain suspended throughout\nthe bulk of the medium. Particles of a\nsuspension are visible to the naked eye.\nProperties of a Suspension\n\u2022Suspension is a heterogeneous\nmixture.\n\u2022The particles of a suspension can be seen\nby the naked eye.\u2022The particles of a suspension scatter a\nbeam of light passing through it and\nmake its path visible.\n\u2022The solute particles settle down when a\nsuspension is left undisturbed, that is,\na suspension is unstable. They can be\nseparated from the mixture by the\nprocess of filtration. When the particles\nsettle down, the suspension breaks and\nit does not scatter light any more.\n2.2.3 WHAT IS A COLLOIDAL\n SOLUTION?\nThe mixture obtained by group D in activity\n2.2 is called a colloid or a colloidal solution.\nThe particles of a colloid are uniformly spread\nthroughout the solution. Due to the relatively\nsmaller size of particles, as compared to that of\na suspension, the mixture appears to be\nhomogeneous. But actually, a colloidal solution\nis a heterogeneous mixture, for example, milk.\nBecause of the small size of colloidal\nparticles, we cannot see them with naked eyes.\nBut, these particles can easily scatter a beam\nof visible light as observed in activity 2.2. This\nscattering of a beam of light is called the\nTyndall effect after the name of the scientist\nwho discovered this effect.\nTyndall effect can also be observed when a\nfine beam of light enters a room through a small\nhole. This happens due to the scattering of light\nby the particles of dust and smoke in the air .\nFig. 2.3: (a) Solution of copper sulphate does not\nshow Tyndall effect, (b) mixture of water\nand milk shows Tyndall effect.(a) (b)\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 18Q\u2022Colloids are big enough to scatter a\nbeam of light passing through it and\nmake its path visible.\n\u2022They do not settle down when left\nundisturbed, that is, a colloid is quite\nstable.\n\u2022They cannot be separated from the\nmixture by the process of filtration. But,\na special technique of separation known\nas centrifugation can be used to\nseparate the colloidal particles.\nThe components of a colloidal solution are\nthe dispersed phase and the dispersion\nmedium. The solute-like component or the\ndispersed particles in a colloid form the\ndispersed phase, and the component in which\nthe dispersed phase is suspended is known\nas the dispersing medium. Colloids are\nclassified according to the state (solid, liquid\nor gas) of the dispersing medium and  the\ndispersed phase. A few common examples are\ngiven in Table 2.1. From this table you can\nsee that they are very common everyday life.Tyndall effect can be observed when\nsunlight passes through the canopy of a dense\nforest. In the forest, mist contains tiny droplets\nof water , which act as particles of colloid\ndispersed in air .\nFig. 2.4:  The Tyndall effect\nuestions\n1.Differentiate between homogen eous and heterogeneous mixtures with examples.\n2.How are sol, solution and suspension different from each other?\n3.To make a saturated solution,  36 g of sodium chloride is dissolved in 100 g of water\nat 293 K. Find its concentration at this temperature.Properties of a Colloid\n\u2022A colloid is a heterogeneous mixture.\n\u2022The size of particles of a colloid is too\nsmall to be individually seen with\nnaked eyes.\nTable 2.1:  Common examples of colloids\nDispersed Dispersing Type Example\nphase Medium\nLiquid Gas Aerosol Fog, clouds, mist\nSolid Gas Aerosol Smoke, automobile exhaust\nGas Liquid Foam Shaving cream\nLiquid Liquid Emulsion Milk, face cream\nSolid Liquid Sol Milk of magnesia, mud\nGas Solid Foam Foam, rubber , sponge, pumice\nLiquid Solid Gel Jelly, cheese, butter\nSolid Solid Solid Sol Coloured gemstone, milky glass\n2024-25\n\nIS MATTER AROUND  US PURE? 192.3Physical and Chemical\nChanges\nIn the pr evious chapter , we have lear nt about\na few physical properties of matter . The\nproperties that can be observed and specified\nlike colour , har dness, rigidity, fluidity,\ndensity, melting point, boiling point etc. are\nthe physical properites.\nThe interconversion of states is a physical\nchange because these changes occur without\na change in composition and no change in the\nchemical nature of the substance. Although\nice, water and water vapour all look different\nand display different physical properties, they\nare chemically the same.\nBoth water and cooking oil  are liquid but\ntheir chemical characteristics are different.\nThey dif fer in odour and inflammability. W e\nknow that oil burns in air whereas water\nextinguishes fire. It is this chemical property\nof oil that makes it dif ferent from water .\nBurning is a chemical change. During this\nprocess one substance reacts with another to\nundergo a change in chemical composition.\nChemical change brings change in the\nchemical properties of matter and we get new\nsubstances. A chemical change is also called\na chemical reaction.\nDuring burning of a candle, both physical\nand chemical changes take place. Can you\ndistinguish these?\nuestions\n1.Classify the following as chemical\nor physical changes:\n\u2022cutting of trees,\n\u2022melting of butter in a pan,\n\u2022rusting of almirah,\n\u2022boiling of water to form steam,\n\u2022passing of electric current,\nthrough water and the water\nbreaking down into hydrogen\nand oxygen gases,\n\u2022dissolving common salt in\nwater ,\n\u2022making a fruit salad with raw\nfruits, andQ\u2022burning of paper and wood.\n2.Try segr egating the things\naround you as pure substances\nor mixtures.\n2.4What are the Types of Pure\nSubstances?\nOn the basis of their chemical composition,\nsubstances can be classified either as elements\nor compounds.\n2.4.1 ELEMENTS\nRobert Boyle was the first scientist to use the\nterm element in 1661. Antoine Laurent\nLavoisier (1743\u201394), a French chemist, was the\nfirst to establish an experimentally useful\ndefinition of an element. He defined an element\nas a basic form of matter that cannot be broken\ndown into simpler substances by chemical\nreactions.\nElements can be normally divided into\nmetals, non-metals and metalloids.\nMetals usually show some or all of the\nfollowing properties:\n\u2022They have a lustre (shine).\n\u2022They have silvery-grey or golden-yellow\ncolour .\n\u2022They conduct heat and electricity.\n\u2022They are ductile (can be drawn into\nwires).\n\u2022They are malleable (can be hammered\ninto thin sheets).\n\u2022They are sonorous (make a ringing\nsound when hit).\nExamples of metals ar e gold, silver ,\ncopper , iron, sodium, potassium etc. Mer cury\nis the only metal that is liquid at room\ntemperature.\nNon-metals usually show some or all of the\nfollowing properties:\n\u2022They display a variety of colours.\n\u2022They are poor conductors of heat and\nelectricity.\n\u2022They are not lustrous, sonorous\nor malleable.\nExamples of non-metals are hydrogen,\noxygen, iodine, carbon (coal, coke), bromine,\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 20chlorine etc. Some elements have intermediate\nproperties between those of metals and non-\nmetals, they are  called metalloids; examples\nare boron, silicon, germanium, etc.\nMore to  know\n2.4.2 COMPOUNDS\nA compound is a substance composed of two\nor more elements, chemically combined with\none another in a fixed proportion.\nWhat do we get when two or more elements\nare combined?\nActivity ______________ 2.4\n\u2022Divide the class into two groups. Give\n5 g of iron filings and 3 g of sulphur\npowder in a china dish to both\nthe groups.\nGroup I\n\u2022Mix and crush iron filings and\nsulphur powder .\nGroup II\n\u2022Mix and crush iron filings and\nsulphur powder . Heat this mixtur e\nstrongly till red hot. Remove from\nflame and let the mixture cool.\nGroups I and II\n\u2022Check for magnetism in the material\nobtained. Bring a magnet near the\nmaterial and check if the material is\nattracted towards the magnet.\u2022Compare the texture and colour of the\nmaterial obtained by the groups.\n\u2022Add carbon disulphide to one part of\nthe  material obtained. Stir well\nand filter .\n\u2022Add dilute sulphuric acid or dilute\nhydrochloric acid to the other part of\nthe material obtained. (Note: teacher\nsupervision is necessary for\nthis activity).\n\u2022Perform all the above steps with both\nthe elements (iron and sulphur)\nseparately.\nNow answer\n\u2022Did the material obtained by the two\ngroups look the same?\n\u2022Which group has obtained a material\nwith magnetic properties?\n\u2022Can we separate the components of the\nmaterial obtained?\n\u2022On adding dilute sulphuric acid or\ndilute hydrochloric acid, did both the\ngroups obtain a gas? Did the gas in\nboth the cases smell the same\nor different?\nThe gas obtained by Group I is hydrogen,\nit is colourless, odourless and combustible\u2013 it\nis not advised to do the combustion test for\nhydrogen in the class. The gas obtained by\nGroup II is hydrogen sulphide. It is a colourless\ngas with the smell of rotten eggs.\nYou must have observed that the pr oducts\nobtained by both the groups show different\nproperties, though the starting materials were\nthe same. Group I has carried out the activity\ninvolving a physical change whereas in case\nof Group II, a chemical change (a chemical\nreaction) has taken place.\n\u2022The material obtained by group I is a\nmixture of the two substances. The\nsubstances given are the elements\u2014iron\nand sulphur .\n\u2022The properties of the mixture are the\nsame as that of its constituents.\u2022The number of elements\nknown at present are more\nthan 100. Ninety-two elements\nare naturally occurring and the\nrest are man-made.\n\u2022Majority of the elements are\nsolid.\n\u2022Eleven elements are in gaseous\nstate at room temperature.\n\u2022Two elements are liquid at\nroom temperature\u2014mercury\nand bromine.\n\u2022Elements, gallium and cesium\nbecome liquid at a temperature\nslightly above room\ntemperature (303 K).\n2024-25\n\nIS MATTER AROUND  US PURE? 21\u2022The material obtained by group II is a\ncompound.\n\u2022On heating the two elements strongly we\nget a compound, which has totally\ndifferent properties compared to the\ncombining elements.\u2022The composition of a compound is the\nsame thr oughout. W e can also observe\nthat the texture and the colour of the\ncompound are the same throughout.\nThus, we can summarise the physical\nand chemical nature of matter in the\nfollowing graphical organiser:Table 2.2: Mixtures and Compounds\nMixtures Compounds\n1.Elements or compounds just mix 1.Elements react to form new compounds.\ntogether to form a mixture and no\nnew compound is formed.\n2.A mixture has a variable composition. 2.The composition of each new substance\nis always fixed.\n3,A mixture shows the properties of the 3.The new substance has totally different\nconstituent substances. properties.\n4.The constituents can be seperated 4.The constituents can be separated only\nfairly easily by physical methods. by chemical or electrochemical\nreactions.\nWhat\nyou have\nlearnt\n\u2022 A mixture contains more than one substance (element and/\nor compound) mixed in any proportion.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 22Exercises\n1.

The major component of a solution is called the\nsolvent, and the minor , the solute.\n\u2022 The concentration of a solution is the amount of solute present\nper unit volume or per unit mass of the solution.\n\u2022 Materials that are insoluble in a solvent and have particles\nthat are visible to naked eyes, form a suspension.\nA suspension is a heterogeneous mixture.\n\u2022 Colloids are heterogeneous mixtures in which the particle\nsize is too small to be seen with the naked eye, but is big\nenough to scatter light. Colloids are useful in industry and\ndaily life. The particles are called the dispersed phase and\nthe medium in which they are distributed is called the\ndispersion medium.\n\u2022 Pure substances can be elements or compounds. An element\nis a form of matter that cannot be broken down by chemical\nreactions into simpler substances. A compound is a substance\ncomposed of two or more different types of elements,\nchemically combined in a fixed proportion.\n\u2022 Properties of a compound are different from its constituent\nelements, whereas a mixture shows the properties of its\nconstituting elements or compounds.\n2024-25\n\nIS MATTER AROUND  US PURE? 23(a) What mass of potassium nitrate would be needed to\nproduce a saturated solution of potassium nitrate in\n50 grams of water at 313 K?\n(b) Pragya makes a saturated solution of potassium chloride\nin water at 353 K and leaves the solution to cool at\nroom temperature.

Ther e are also other\nforms of energy like mechanical energy, light\nenergy, etc. W e have talked about mechanical\nenergy in the pr evious chapters. Y ou have\nbeen taught about conservation of energy,\nwhich states that we can neither create nor\ndestr oy ener gy. W e  can just change it fr om\none for m to another . When you clap, a sound\nis produced. Can you produce sound without\nutilising your energy? Which form of energy\ndid you use to produce sound? In this\nchapter we are going to learn how sound is\nproduced and how it is transmitted through\na medium and received by our ears.\n11.1 Production of Sound\nActivity _____________ 11.1\n\u2022Take a tuning fork and set it vibrating\nby striking its pr ong on a rubber pad.\nBring it near your ear .\n\u2022Do you hear any sound?\n\u2022Touch one of the pr ongs of the vibrating\ntuning fork with your finger and shar e\nyour experience with your friends.\n\u2022Now, suspend a table tennis ball or a\nsmall plastic ball by a thr ead fr om a\nsupport [T ake a big needle and a\nthread, put a knot at one end of the\nthread, and then with the help of the\nneedle pass the thr ead thr ough the\nball]. T ouch the ball gently with the\nprong of a vibrating tuning\nfork (Fig. 11.1).\n\u2022Observe what happens and discuss\nwith your friends.Activity _____________ 11.2\n\u2022Fill water in a beaker or a glass up to\nthe brim. Gently touch the water sur face\nwith one of the pr ongs of the vibrating\ntuning fork, as shown in Fig. 1 1.2.\n\u2022Next dip the pr ongs of the vibrating\ntuning fork in water , as shown in Fig.\n11.3.\n\u2022Observe what happens in both the\ncases.\n\u2022Discuss with your friends why this\nhappens.Fig. 11.1:  Vibrating tuning fork just touching the\nsuspended table tennis ball.\nFig. 11.2:   One of the prongs of the vibrating tuning\nfork touching the water sur face.11\nS SS SSOUNDOUNDOUND\nOUNDOUNDChapter\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 128the vibrating object to the ear . A particle of\nthe medium in contact with the vibrating\nobject is first displaced fr om its equilibrium\nposition. It then exerts a for ce on the adjacent\nparticle. As a r esult of which the adjacent\nparticle gets displaced fr om its position of\nrest. After displacing the adjacent particle the\nfirst particle comes back to its original\nposition. This pr ocess continues in the\nmedium till the sound r eaches your ear . The\ndisturbance created by a source of  sound in\nthe medium travels through the medium and\nnot the particles of the medium.\nA wave is a disturbance that moves\nthrough a medium when the particles of the\nmedium set neighbouring particles into\nmotion. They in tur n produce similar motion\nin others. The particles of the medium do not\nmove forwar d themselves, but the\ndisturbance is carried forwar d. This is what\nhappens during pr opagation of sound in a\nmedium, hence sound can be visualised as a\nwave. Sound waves are characterised by the\nmotion of particles in the medium and ar e\ncalled mechanical waves.\nAir is the most common medium thr ough\nwhich sound travels. When a vibrating object\nmoves forward, it pushes and compresses the\nair in front of it creating a region of high\npressur e. This r egion is called a compr ession\n(C), as shown in Fig. 11.4. This compression\nstarts to move away from the vibrating object.\nWhen the vibrating object moves backwar ds,\nit creates a r egion of low pr essur e called\nrarefaction (R), as shown in Fig. 11.4. As the\nobject moves back and forth rapidly, a series\nof compressions and rarefactions is created in\nthe air . These make the sound wave thatFig. 11.3: Both the prongs of the vibrating tuning\nfork dipped in water\nFrom the above activities what do you\nconclude? Can you pr oduce sound without\na vibrating object?\nIn the above activities we have pr oduced\nsound by striking the tuning fork. W e can\nalso pr oduce sound by plucking, scratching,\nrubbing, blowing or shaking dif ferent objects.\nAs per the above activities what do we do to\nthe objects? W e set the objects vibrating and\nproduce sound. V ibration means a kind of\nrapid to and fr o motion of an object. The\nsound of the human voice is pr oduced due\nto vibrations in the vocal cor ds. When a bir d\nflaps its wings, do you hear any sound? Think\nhow the buzzing sound accompanying a bee\nis produced. A str etched rubber band when\nplucked vibrates and produces sound.

The\nmatter or substance thr ough which sound\nis transmitted is called a medium. It can be\nsolid, liquid or gas. Sound moves thr ough a\nmedium from the point of generation to the\nlistener . When an object vibrates, it sets the\nparticles of the medium ar ound it vibrating.\nThe particles do not travel all the way fromFig. 11.4: A vibrating object creating a series of\ncompr essions (C) and rar efactions (R) in\nthe medium.\n2024-25\n\nSOUND 129propagates through the medium.\nCompr ession is the r egion of high pr essur e\nand rar efaction is the r egion of low pr essur e.\nPressur e is related to the number of particles\nof a medium in a given volume. Mor e density\nof the particles in the medium gives mor e\npressur e and vice versa. Thus, pr opagation\nof sound can be visualised as pr opagation of\ndensity variations or pr essur e variations in\nthe medium.\nuestion\n1.How does the sound produced by\na vibrating object in a medium\nreach your ear?\n2.Explain how sound is produced\nby your school bell.\n3.Why are sound waves called\nmechanical waves?\n4.Suppose you and your friend are\non the moon. W ill you be able to\nhear any sound pr oduced by\nyour friend?\n11.2.1 SOUND  WAVES  ARE LONGITUDINAL\nWAVES\nActivity _____________ 11.4\n\u2022Take a slinky.  Ask your friend to hold\none end. Y ou hold the other end.\nNow str etch the slinky as shown in\nFig. 11.5(a). Then give it a sharp push\ntowards your friend.\n\u2022What do you notice? If you move your\nhand pushing and pulling the slinky\nalternatively, what will you observe?\n\u2022If you mark a dot on the slinky, you\nwill observe that the dot on the slinky\nwill move back and forth parallel to\nthe direction of the propagation of the\ndisturbance.The regions where the coils become closer\nare called compressions (C) and the regions\nwhere the coils are further apart are called\nrarefactions (R). As we already know, sound\npropagates in the medium as a series of\ncompressions and rarefactions. Now, we can\ncompare the propagation of disturbance in a\nslinky with the sound propagation in the\nmedium. These waves are called longitudinal\nwaves. In these waves the individual particles\nof the medium move in a direction parallel to\nthe direction of propagation of the disturbance.\nThe particles do not move from one place to\nanother but they simply oscillate back and\nforth about their position of rest. This is\nexactly how a sound wave propagates, hence\nsound waves are longitudinal waves.\nThere is also another type of wave, called\na transverse wave. In a transverse wave\nparticles do not oscillate along the direction\nof wave propagation but oscillate up and down\nabout their mean position as the wave travels.\nThus, a transverse wave is the one in which\nthe individual particles of the medium move\nabout their mean positions in a direction\nperpendicular to the direction of wave\npropagation. When we drop a pebble in a\npond, the waves you see on the water surface\nis an example of transverse wave. Light is a\ntransverse wave but for light, the oscillations\nare not of the medium particles or their\npressure or density\u2014 it is not a mechanical\nwave. Y ou will come to know mor e about\ntransverse waves in higher classes.\n11.2.2 CHARACTERISTICS  OF A SOUND\nWAVE\nWe can describe a sound wave by its\n\u2022frequency\n\u2022amplitude and\n\u2022speed.Q\nA sound wave in graphic form is shown in\nFig. 11.6(c), which represents how density and\npressure change when the sound wave moves\nin the medium. The density as well as the\npressure of the medium at a given time varies\nwith distance, above and below the average\nvalue of density and pressure. Fig. 11.6(a) and(b)(a)\nFig. 11.5:  Longitudinal wave in a slinky.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 130Heinrich Rudolph Hertz\nwas born on 22 February\n1857 in Hamburg,\nGermany and educated at\nthe University of Berlin. He\nconfirmed J.C. Maxwell\u2019s\nelectromagnetic theory by\nhis experiments. He laid the\nfoundation for future\ndevelopment of radio, telephone, telegraph\nand even television. He also discovered the\nphotoelectric effect which was later\nexplained by Albert Einstein. The SI unit of\nfrequency was named as hertz in his honour .Fig. 11.6(b) represent the density and\npressure variations, respectively, as a sound\nwave propagates in the medium.\nCompressions are the regions where\nparticles are crowded together and\nrepresented by the upper portion of the curve\nin Fig. 11.6(c). The peak represents the region\nof maximum compression. Thus,\ncompressions are regions where density as\nwell as pressure is high. Rarefactions are the\nregions of low pressure where particles are\nspread apart and are represented by the\nvalley, that is, the lower portion of the curve\nin Fig. 11.6(c). A peak is called the crest and a\nvalley is called the trough of a wave.\nThe distance between two consecutive\ncompressions (C) or two consecutive\nrarefactions (R) is called the wavelength, as\nshown in Fig. 11.6(c), The wavelength is\nusually represented by \u03bb (Greek letter\nlambda). Its SI unit is metre (m).\nH. R. Hertz\nFig. 11.6: Sound propagates as density or pressure variations as shown in (a) and (b), (c) represents\ngraphically the density and pr essur e variations.Frequency tells us how frequently an\nevent occurs. Suppose you are beating a\ndrum. How many times you are beating the\ndrum in unit time is called the frequency of\nyour beating the drum. W e know that when\nsound is propagated through a medium, the\n2024-25\n\nSOUND 131How the brain interprets the frequency\nof an emitted sound is called its pitch. The\nfaster the vibration of the source, the\nhigher is the frequency and the higher is\nthe pitch, as shown in Fig. 11.7. Thus, a\nhigh pitch sound corresponds to more\nnumber of compressions and rarefactions\npassing a fixed point per unit time.\nObjects of different sizes and conditions\nvibrate at different frequencies to produce\nsounds of different pitch.\nThe magnitude of the maximum\ndisturbance in the medium on either side of\nthe mean value is called the amplitude of the\nwave. It is usually represented by the letter A,as shown in Fig. 11.6(c). For sound its unit\nwill be that of density or pressure.\nThe loudness or softness of a sound is\ndetermined basically by its amplitude. The\namplitude of the sound wave depends upon\nthe force with which an object is made to\nvibrate. If we strike a table lightly, we hear a\nsoft sound because we produce a sound wavedensity of the medium oscillates between a\nmaximum value and a minimum value. The\nchange in density from the maximum value\nto the minimum value, then again to the\nmaximum value, makes one complete\noscillation. The number of such oscillations\nper unit time is the frequency of the sound\nwave. If we can count the number of the\ncompressions or rarefactions that cross us\nper unit time, we will get the frequency of\nthe sound wave. It is usually represented by\n\u03bd (Greek letter , nu). Its SI unit is hertz\n(symbol, Hz).\nThe time taken by two consecutive\ncompressions or rarefactions to cross a fixed\npoint is called the time period of the wave. In\nother words, we can say that the time taken\nfor one complete oscillation is called the time\nperiod of the sound wave. It is represented by\nthe symbol T . Its SI unit is second (s).\nFrequency and time period are related as\nfollows:\n A violin and a flute may both be played at\nthe same time in an orchestra. Both sounds\ntravel through the same medium, that is, air\nand arrive at our ear at the same time. Both\nsounds travel at the same speed irrespective\nof the source. But the sounds we receive are\ndifferent. This is due to the different\ncharacteristics associated with the sound.\nPitch is one of the characteristics.=1vTFig. 11.7:  Low pitch sound has low frequency and\nhigh pitch of sound has high frequency.\nFig. 11.8: Soft sound has small amplitude and\nlouder sound has large amplitude.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 132QQuestions\n1.Which wave property determines\n(a) loudness, (b) pitch?\n2.Guess which sound has a higher\npitch: guitar or car horn?\nThe speed of sound is defined as the\ndistance which a point on a wave, such as a\ncompression or a rarefaction, travels per unit\ntime.\nWe know,\nspeed, v = distance / time\n= \u03bb\nTExample 11.1 A sound wave has a\nfrequency of 2 kHz and wave length\n35 cm. How long will it take to travel\n1.5 km?\nSolution:\nGiven,\nFrequency, \u03bd = 2 kHz = 2000 Hz\nWavelength, \u03bb = 35 cm = 0.35 m\nWe know that speed, v of the wave\n= wavelength \u00d7 frequency\nv= \u03bb \u03bd\n= 0.35 m  2000 Hz = 700 m/s\nThe time taken by the wave to travel a\ndistance, d of 1.5 km is\nThus sound will take 2.1 s to travel a\ndistance of 1.5 km.\nuestions\n1.What ar e wavelength, fr equency,\ntime period and amplitude of a\nsound wave?\n2.How are the wavelength and\nfrequency of a sound wave\nrelated to its speed?\n3.Calculate the wavelength of a\nsound wave whose fr equency is\n220 Hz and speed is 440 m/s  in\na given medium.\n4.A person is listening to a tone of\n500 Hz sitting at a distance of\n450 m from the source of the\nsound. What is the time interval\nbetween successive compr essions\nfrom the source?\nThe amount of sound energy passing each\nsecond through unit area is called the intensity\nof sound. W e sometimes use the ter ms\n\u201cloudness\u201d and \u201cintensity\u201d interchangeably,\nbut they are not the same. Loudness is a\nmeasure of the response of the ear to the sound.\nEven when two sounds are of equal intensity,\nwe may hear one as louder than the other\nsimply because our ear detects it better .of less energy (amplitude). If we hit the table\nhard we hear a louder sound. Can you tell\nwhy? A sound wave spreads out from its\nsource. As it moves away from the source its\namplitude as well as its loudness decreases.\nLouder sound can travel a larger distance as\nit is associated with higher energy. Fig. 11.8\nshows the wave shapes of a loud and a soft\nsound of the same frequency.\nThe quality or timber of sound is that\ncharacteristic which enables us to distinguish\none sound from another having the same pitch\nand loudness. The sound which is more\npleasant is said to be of a rich quality. A sound\nof single frequency is called a tone. The sound\nwhich is produced due to a mixture of several\nfrequencies is called a note and is pleasant to\nlisten to. Noise is unpleasant to the ear! Music\nis pleasant to hear and is of rich quality.\nHere \u03bb is the wavelength of the sound wave. It\nis the distance travelled by the sound wave in\none time period ( T) of the wave. Thus,\nv = \u03bb \u03bd \nor v = \u03bb \u03bd\nThat is, speed = wavelength \u00d7 frequency.\nThe speed of sound remains almost the\nsame for all frequencies in a given medium\nunder the same physical conditions.\n2024-25\n\nSOUND 133uestion\n1.Distinguish between loudness\nand intensity of sound.uestion\n1.In which of the thr ee media, air ,\nwater or iron, does sound travel\nthe fastest at a particular\ntemperature?\n11.3 Reflection of Sound\nSound bounces off a solid or a liquid like a\nrubber ball bounces off a wall. Like light, sound\ngets reflected at the surface of a solid or liquid\nand follows the same laws of reflection as you\nhave studied in earlier classes. The directions\nin which the sound is incident and is reflected\nmake equal angles with the normal to the\nreflecting surface at the point of incidence, and\nthe three are in the same plane. An obstacle of\nlarge size which may be polished or rough is\nneeded for the reflection of sound waves.\nActivity _____________ 11.5\n\u2022Take two identical pipes, as shown in\nFig. 11.9. Y ou can make the pipes\nusing chart paper . The length of the\npipes should be sufficiently long\nas shown.\n\u2022Arrange them on a table near a wall.\n\u2022Keep a clock near the open end of one\nof the pipes and try to hear the sound\nof the clock through the other pipe.\n\u2022Adjust the position of the pipes so\nthat you can best hear the sound of\nthe clock.\n\u2022Now, measure the angles of incidence\nand reflection and see the\nrelationship between the angles.\n\u2022Lift the pipe on the right vertically\nto a small height and observe\nwhat happens.\n(In place of a clock, a mobile phone\non vibrating mode may also be used.)QQ\n11.2.3 SPEED OF SOUND  IN DIFFERENT\nMEDIA\nSound propagates through a medium at a finite\nspeed. The sound of a thunder is heard  a little\nlater than the flash of light is seen. So, we can\nmake out that sound travels with a speed\nwhich is much less than the speed of light. The\nspeed of sound depends on the properties of\nthe medium thr ough which it travels. Y ou will\nlearn about this dependence in higher classes.\nThe speed of sound in a medium depends on\ntemperature of the medium. The speed of\nsound decreases when we go from solid to\ngaseous state. In any medium as we increase\nthe temperature, the speed of sound increases.\nFor example, the speed of sound in air is 331\nm s\u20131 at 0 \u00baC and 344 m s\u20131 at 22 \u00baC. The speeds\nof sound at a particular temperature in various\nmedia ar e listed in T able 11.1. Y ou need not\nmemorise the values.\nTable 11.1: Speed of sound in\ndifferent media at 25 \u00baC\nState Substance Speed in m/s\nSolids Aluminium 6420\nNickel 6040\nSteel 5960\nIron 5950\nBrass 4700\nGlass (Flint) 3980\nLiquids Water (Sea) 1531\nWater (distilled) 1498\nEthanol 1207\nMethanol 1103\nGases Hydrogen 1284\nHelium 965\nAir 346\nOxygen 316\nSulphur dioxide 213Fig. 11.9:  Reflection of sound\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 13411.3.1 ECHO\nIf we shout or clap near a suitable reflecting\nobject such as a tall building or a\nmountain,we will hear the same sound\nagain a little  later . This sound which we\nhear is called an echo. The sensation of\nsound persists in our brain for about 0.1\ns. To hear a distinct echo the time interval\nbetween the original sound and the\nreflected one must be  at least 0.1s. If we\ntake the speed of sound to be 344 m/s at a\ngiven temperatur e, say at 22 \u00baC in air , the\nsound must go to the obstacle and reach\nback the ear of the listener on reflection after\n0.1s. Hence, the total distance covered by\nthe sound from the point of generation to\nthe reflecting surface and back should be\nat least (344 m/s) \u00d7 0.1 s = 34.4 m. Thus,\nfor hearing distinct echoes, the minimum\ndistance of the obstacle from the source of\nsound must be half of this distance, that\nis, 17.2 m. This distance will change with\nthe temperatur e of air . Echoes may be hear d\nmore than once due to successive or\nmultiple reflections. The rolling of thunder\nis due to the successive reflections of the\nsound from a number of reflecting surfaces,\nsuch as the clouds and the land.\n11.3.2 REVERBERATION\nA sound created in a big hall will persist\nby repeated reflection from the walls until\nit is reduced to a value where it is no longer\naudible. The repeated reflection that\nresults in this persistence of sound is\ncalled reverberation. In an auditorium or\nbig hall excessive reverberation is highly\nundesirable. To reduce reverberation, the\nroof and walls of the auditorium are\ngenerally covered with sound-absorbent\nmaterials like compressed fibreboard,\nrough plaster or draperies. The seat\nmaterials are also selected on the basis of\ntheir sound absorbing properties.\nExample 11.2  A person clapped his hands\nnear a cliff and heard the echo after 2 s.What is the distance of the cliff from the\nperson if the speed of the sound, v is\ntaken as 346 m s\u20131?\nSolution:\nGiven,\nSpeed of sound, v = 346 m s\u20131\nTime taken for hearing the echo,\nt = 2 s\nDistance travelled by the sound\n= v \u00d7 t = 346 m s\u20131 \u00d7 2 s = 692 m\nIn 2 s sound has to travel twice the\ndistance between the cliff and the\nperson. Hence, the distance between the\ncliff and the person\n= 692 m/2 = 346 m.\nQ\nHorn\nMegaphone\nFig 11.10:   A megaphone and a horn.uestion\n1.An echo is heard in 3 s. What is\nthe distance of the reflecting\nsurface from the source, given that\nthe speed of sound is  342  m s\u20131?\n11.3.3 USES OF MULTIPLE  REFLECTION\nOF SOUND\n1.Megaphones or loudhailers, horns,\nmusical instruments such as trumpets\nand shehanais , are all designed to send\nsound in a particular direction without\nspreading it in all directions, as shown\nin Fig 11.10.\n2024-25\n\nSOUND 1352.Stethoscope is a medical instrument\nused for listening to sounds produced\nwithin the body, mainly in the heart or\nlungs. In stethoscopes the sound of the\npatient\u2019s heartbeat reaches the doctor\u2019s\nears by multiple reflection of sound, as\nshown in Fig.11.11.\nFig. 11.12:  Curved ceiling of a conference hall.Fig. 11.13:  Sound board used in a big hall.\nuestion\n1.Why are the ceilings of concert\nhalls curved?\n11.4Range of Hearing\nThe audible range of sound for human beings\nextends from about 20 Hz to 20000 Hz (one\nHz = one cycle/s). Children under the age of\nfive and some animals, such as dogs can hear\nup to 25 kHz (1 kHz = 1000 Hz). As people\ngrow older their ears become less sensitive to\nhigher frequencies. Sounds of frequencies\nbelow 20 Hz are called infrasonic sound or\ninfrasound. If we could hear infrasound we\nwould hear the vibrations of a pendulum just\nas we hear the vibrations of the wings of a bee.\nRhinoceroses communicate using infrasound\nof frequency as low as 5 Hz. Whales and\nelephants produce sound in the infrasound\nrange. It is observed that some animals get\ndisturbed before earthquakes. Earthquakes\nproduce low-frequency infrasound before the\nmain shock waves begin which possibly alert\nthe animals. Frequencies higher than 20 kHz\nare called ultrasonic sound or ultrasound.\nUltrasound is produced by animals such as\ndolphins, bats and porpoises. Moths of certain\nfamilies have very sensitive hearing equipment.\nThese moths can hear the high frequencyQ\nFig.11.11:  Stethoscope\n3.Generally the ceilings of concert halls,\nconference halls and cinema halls are\ncurved so that sound after reflection\nreaches all corners of the hall, as\nshown in Fig 1 1.12. Sometimes a\ncurved soundboard may be placed\nbehind the stage so that the sound,\nafter reflecting from the sound board,\nspreads evenly across the width of the\nhall (Fig 1 1.13).In these instruments, a tube followed\nby a conical opening reflects sound\nsuccessively to guide most of the\nsound waves from the source in the\nforward direction towards the\naudience.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 136squeaks of the bat and know when a bat\nis flying nearby, and are able to escape\ncapture.

Cork is  a substance\nwhich comes fr om the bark of a tree. This\nwas in the year 1665 when Hooke made this\nchance observation thr ough a self-designed\nmicroscope. Robert Hooke called these boxes\ncells. Cell is a Latin wor d for \u2018a little r oom\u2019.\nThis may seem to be a very small and\ninsignificant incident but it is very important\nin the history of science. This was the very first\ntime that someone had observed that living\nthings appear to consist of separate units. The\nuse of the word \u2018cell\u2019 to describe these units is\nbeing used till this day in biology.\nLet us find out about cells.\n5.1What are Living Organisms\nMade Up of?\nActivity ______________ 5.1\n\u2022Let us take a small piece fr om an onion\nbulb. W ith the help of a pair of for ceps,\nwe can peel of f the skin (called\nepider mis) fr om the concave side (inner\nlayer) of the onion. This layer can be\nput immediately in a watch-glass\ncontaining water . This will pr event the\npeel fr om getting folded or getting dry.\nWhat do we do with this peel?\n\u2022Let us take a glass slide, put a dr op of\nwater on it and transfer a small piece\nof the peel fr om the watch glass to the\nslide. Make sur e that the peel is\nperfectly flat on the slide. A thin camel\nhair paintbrush might be necessary to\nhelp transfer the peel. Now we put a\ndrop of safranin solution on this piece\nfollowed by a cover slip. Take care toavoid air bubbles while putting the\ncover slip with the help of a mounting\nneedle. Ask your teacher for help. W e\nhave prepared a temporary mount of\nonion peel.

Can we find out names of some\nmore unicellular or ganisms?\nEvery multi-cellular or ganism has come\nfrom a single cell. How? Cells divide to\nproduce cells of their own kind. All cells thus\ncome fr om pr e-existing cells.\nActivity ______________ 5.2\n\u2022We can try pr eparing temporary\nmounts of leaf peels, tip of r oots of\nonion or even peels of onions of dif ferent\nsizes.\n\u2022After per forming the above activity, let\nus see what the answers to the following\nquestions would be:\n(a)Do all cells look alike in ter ms of\nshape and size?\n(b)Do all cells look alike in structur e?\n(c)Could we find dif ferences among\ncells from different parts of a\nplant body?\n(d)What similarities could we find?\nSome or ganisms can also have cells of\ndiffer\nent kinds.

Do we see similar structur es or\ndifferent structur es?\nWhat are these structures?\nThese structur es look similar to each other .\nTogether they for m a big structure like an\nonion bulb! W e find fr om this activity that\nonion bulbs of dif ferent sizes have similar\nsmall structures visible under a micr oscope.\nThe cells of the onion peel will all look the\nsame, r egardless of the size of the onion they\ncame from.\nThese small structures that we see ar e\nthe basic building units of the onion bulb.\nThese structur es ar e called cells. Not only\nonions, but all or ganisms that we observe\naround ar e made up of cells. However , ther e\nare also single cells that live on their own.\nCells wer e first discover ed by\nRobert Hooke  in 1665. He observed\nthe cells in a cork slice with the help\nof a primitive micr oscope.\nLeeuwenhoek (1674), with the\nimproved micr oscope, discover ed the\nfree living cells in pond water for the\nfirst time.  It was Robert Br own in\n1831 who discovered the nucleus in\nthe cell.   Purkinje in 1839 coined the\nterm \u2018pr otoplasm\u2019 for the fluid\nsubstance of the cell. The cell theory,\nthat all the plants and animals are\ncomposed of cells and that the cell is\nthe basic unit of life, was pr esented\nby two biologists, Schleiden (1838)\nand  Schwan n (1839). The cell theory\nwas further expanded by V irchow\n(1855) by suggesting  that all cells\narise  fr om pr e-existing cells.  W ith the\ndiscovery of the electr on micr oscope\nin 1940, it was possible to observe and\nunderstand the complex structur e of\nthe cell and its various or ganelles.\nThe invention of magnifying lenses led to\nthe discovery of the micr oscopic world. It is\nnow known that a single cell may constitute\na whole or ganism as in Amoeba,\nNerve Cell\nFat cell\n2024-25\n\nTHE FUNDAMENT AL UNIT OF LIFE 51The shape and size of cells are related to\nthe specific function they per form. Some cells\nlike Amoeba have changing shapes. In some\ncases the cell shape could be mor e or less\nfixed and peculiar for a particular type of cell;\nfor example, nerve cells have a typical shape.\nEach living cell has the capacity to\nperform certain basic functions that ar e\ncharacteristic of all living for ms. How does\na living cell per form these basic functions?\nWe know that ther e is a division of labour in\nmulticellular or ganisms such as human\nbeings. This means that dif ferent parts of\nthe human body per form dif ferent functions.\nThe human body has a heart to pump blood,\na stomach to digest food and so on. Similarly,\ndivision of labour is also seen within a single\ncell. In fact, each such cell has got certain\nspecific components within it known as cell\norganelles. Each kind of cell or ganelle\nperforms a special function, such as making\nnew material in the cell, clearing up the\nwaste material fr om the cell and so on. A\ncell is able to live and per form all its\nfunctions because of these or ganelles. These\norganelles together constitute the basic unit\ncalled the cell. It is inter esting that all cells\nare found to have the same or ganelles, no\nmatter what their function is or what\norganism they ar e found in.\nuestions\n1.Who discovered cells, and how?\n2.Why is the cell called the\nstructural and functional unit of\nlife?\n5.2What is a Cell Made Up of?\nWhat is the Structural\nOrganisation of a Cell?\nWe saw above that the cell has special\ncomponents called or ganelles. How is a cell\norganised?\nIf we study a cell under a microscope, we\nwould come across thr ee featur es in almostevery cell; plasma membrane, nucleus and\ncytoplasm. All activities inside the cell and\ninteractions of the cell with its envir onment\nare possible due to these featur es. Let us see\nhow.\n5.2.1 PLASMA  MEMBRANE  OR CELL\nMEMBRANE\nThis is the outer most covering of the cell that\nseparates the contents of the cell fr om its\nexternal envir onment. The plasma membrane\nallows or per mits the entry and exit of some\nmaterials in and out of the cell. It also\nprevents movement of some other materials.\nThe cell membrane, ther efore, is called a\nselectively per meable membrane.\nHow does the movement of substances\ntake place into the cell? How do substances\nmove out of the cell?\nSome substances like carbon dioxide or\noxygen can move acr oss the cell membrane\nby a pr ocess called dif fusion. W e have studied\nthe pr ocess of dif fusion in earlier chapters.\nWe saw that there is spontaneous movement\nof a substance fr om a r egion of high\nconcentration to a r egion wher e its\nconcentration is low.\nSomething similar to this happens in cells\nwhen, for example, some substance like CO2\n(which is cellular waste and r equir es to be\nexcreted out by the cell) accumulates in high\nconcentrations inside the cell. In the cell\u2019s\nexter nal envir onment, the concentration of\nCO2 is low as compar ed to that inside the\ncell. As soon as ther e is a dif ference of\nconcentration of CO2 inside and outside a cell,\nCO2 moves out of the cell, fr om a r egion of\nhigh concentration, to a r egion of low\nconcentration outside the cell by the pr ocess\nof dif fusion. Similarly, O2 enters the cell by\nthe pr ocess of dif fusion when the level or\nconcentration of O2 inside the cell decreases.\nThus, dif fusion plays an important r ole in\ngaseous exchange between the cells as well\nas the cell and its exter nal envir onment.\nWater also obeys the law of dif fusion. The\nmovement of water molecules through such a\nselectively permeable membrane is called osmosis.Q\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 52The movement of water across the plasma\nmembrane is also affected by the\namount of substance dissolved in water. Thus,\nosmosis is the net diffusion of water across a\nselectively permeable membrane toward a\nhigher solute concentration .\nWhat will happen if we put an animal cell\nor a plant cell into a solution of sugar or salt\nin water?\nOne of the following thr ee things could\nhappen:\n1.If the medium surrounding the cell has\na higher water concentration than the\ncell, meaning that the outside solution\nis very dilute, the cell will gain water by\nosmosis. Such a solution is known as\na hypotonic solution.\nWater molecules are free to pass\nacross the cell membrane in both\ndirections, but more water will come\ninto the cell than will leave. The net\n(overall) result is that water enters the\ncell. The cell is likely to swell up.\n2.If the medium has exactly the same\nwater concentration as the cell, there\nwill be no net movement of water across\nthe cell membrane. Such a solution is\nknown as an isotonic solution.\nWater crosses the cell membrane in\nboth directions, but the amount going\nin is the same as the amount going out,\nso there is no overall movement of\nwater. The cell will stay the same size.\n3.If the medium has a lower\nconcentration of water than the cell,\nmeaning that it is a very concentrated\nsolution, the cell will lose water by\nosmosis. Such a solution is known as\na hypertonic solution.\nAgain, water cr osses the cell\nmembrane in both dir ections, but this\ntime mor e water leaves the cell than\nenters it. Ther efore the cell will shrink.\nThus, osmosis is a special case of dif fusion\nthrough a selectively permeable membrane.\nNow let us try out the following activity:Activity ______________ 5.3\nOsmosis with an egg\n(a)Remove the shell of an egg by dissolving\nit in dilute hydr ochloric acid. The shell\nis mostly calcium carbonate. A thin\nouter skin now encloses the egg. Put\nthe egg in pur e water and observe after\n5 minutes. What do we observe?\nThe egg swells because water passes\ninto it by osmosis.\n(b)Place a similar de-shelled egg in a\nconcentrated salt solution and observe\nfor 5 minutes. The egg shrinks. Why?\nWater passes out of the egg solution\ninto the salt solution because the salt\nsolution is mor e concentrated.\nWe can also try a similar activity with dried\nraisins or apricots.\nActivity ______________ 5.4\n\u2022Put dried raisins or apricots in plain\nwater and leave them for some time.\nThen place them into a concentrated\nsolution of sugar or salt. Y ou will\nobserve the following:\n(a)Each gains water and swells\nwhen placed in water .\n(b)However , when placed in the\nconcentrated solution it loses\nwater , and consequently shrinks.\nUnicellular freshwater organisms and\nmost plant cells tend to gain water thr ough\nosmosis. Absorption of water by plant r oots\nis also an example of osmosis.\nThus, dif fusion is important in exhange\nof gases and water in the life of a cell. In\nadditions to this, the cell also obtains\nnutrition fr om its envir onment. Dif ferent\nmolecules move in and out of the cell\nthrough a type of transport r equiring use\nof ener gy.\nThe plasma membrane is flexible and is\nmade up of organic molecules called lipids\nand pr oteins. However , we can observe the\nstructur e of the plasma membrane only\nthrough an electr on micr oscope.\nThe flexibility of the cell membrane also\nenables the cell to engulf in food and other\nmaterial from its external environment. Such\nprocesses are known as endocytosis. Amoeba\nacquires its food through such processes.\n2024-25\n\nTHE FUNDAMENT AL UNIT OF LIFE 53Activity ______________ 5.5\n\u2022Find out about electron microscopes\nfrom resour ces in the school library or\nthrough the inter net. Discuss it with\nyour teacher .\nuestions\n1.How do substances like CO2 and\nwater move in and out of the cell?\nDiscuss.\n2.Why is the plasma membrane\ncalled a selectively per meable\nmembrane?\n5.2.2 CELL WALL\nPlant cells, in addition to the plasma\nmembrane, have another rigid outer covering\ncalled the cell wall. The cell wall lies outside\nthe plasma membrane. The plant cell wall is\nmainly composed of cellulose. Cellulose is a\ncomplex substance and provides structural\nstrength to plants.\nWhen a living plant cell loses water\nthrough osmosis ther e is shrinkage or\ncontraction of the contents of the cell away\nfrom the cell wall. This phenomenon is known\nas plasmolysis. W e can observe this\nphenomenon by per forming the following\nactivity:\nActivity ______________ 5.6\n\u2022Mount the peel of a Rhoeo leaf in water\non a slide and examine cells under\nthe high power of a microscope. Note\nthe small green granules, called\nchlor oplasts. They contain a gr een\nsubstance called chlor ophyll. Put a\nstrong solution of sugar or salt on the\nmounted leaf on the slide. W ait for a\nminute and observe under a\nmicroscope. What do we see?\n\u2022Now place some Rhoeo leaves in boiling\nwater for a few minutes. This kills the\ncells. Then mount one leaf on a slide\nand observe it under a microscope. Put\na strong solution of sugar or salt on\nthe mounted leaf on the slide. Wait for\na minute and observe it again. What\ndo we find? Did plasmolysis occur now?What do we infer from this activity? It\nappears that only living cells, and not dead\ncells, are able to absorb water by osmosis.\nCell walls per mit the cells of plants, fungi\nand bacteria to withstand very dilute\n(hypotonic) exter nal media without bursting.\nIn such media the cells tend to take up water\nby osmosis. The cell swells, building up\npressur e against the cell wall. The wall exerts\nan equal pr essur e against the swollen cell.\nBecause of their walls, such cells can\nwithstand much gr eater changes in the\nsurrounding medium than animal cells.\n5.2.3 NUCLEUS\nRemember the temporary mount of onion peel\nwe pr epared? W e had put iodine solution on\nthe peel. Why? What would we see if we tried\nobserving the peel without putting the iodine\nsolution? T ry it and see what the dif ference\nis. Further , when we put iodine solution on\nthe peel, did each cell get evenly colour ed?\nAccording to their chemical composition\ndifferent r egions of cells get colour ed\ndifferentially. Some r egions appear darker\nthan other r egions. Apart fr om iodine solution\nwe could also use safranin solution or\nmethylene blue solution to stain the cells.\nWe have observed cells fr om an onion; let\nus now observe cells fr om our own body.\nActivity ______________ 5.7\n\u2022Let us take a glass slide with a dr op of\nwater on it. Using an ice-cr eam spoon\ngently scrape the inside sur face of the\ncheek. Does any material get stuck on\nthe spoon? W ith the help of a needle\nwe can transfer this material and\nspread it evenly on the glass slide kept\nready for this. T o colour the material\nwe can put a dr op of methylene blue\nsolution on it. Now the material is r eady\nfor observation under micr oscope. Do\nnot forget to put a cover-slip on it!\n\u2022What do we observe? What is the\nshape of the cells we see? Draw it on\nthe observation sheet.Q\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 54\u2022Was ther e a darkly colour ed, spherical\nor oval, dot-like structure near the\ncentre of each cell? This structure is\ncalled nucleus. W ere ther e similar\nstructur es in onion peel cells?\nThe nucleus has a double layer ed covering\ncalled nuclear membrane. The nuclear\nmembrane has por es which allow the transfer\nof material fr om inside the nucleus to its\noutside, that is, to the cytoplasm (which we\nwill talk about in section 5.2.4).\nThe nucleus contains chr omosomes,\nwhich ar e visible as r od-shaped structures\nonly when the cell is about to divide.\nChromosomes contain infor mation for\ninheritance of characters from parents to next\ngeneration in the for m of DNA (Deoxyribo\nNucleic Acid) molecules. Chr omosomes ar e\ncomposed of DNA and pr otein. DNA molecules\ncontain the infor mation necessary for\nconstructing and or ganising cells. Functional\nsegments of DNA ar e called genes. In a cell\nwhich is not dividing, this DNA is pr esent as\npart of chr omatin material. Chr\nomatin\nmaterial is visible as entangled mass of thr ead\nlike structur es. Whenever the cell is about to\ndivide, the chr omatin material gets or ganised\ninto chr omosomes.\nThe nucleus plays a central r ole in cellular\nreproduction, the pr ocess by which a single\ncell divides and for ms two new cells. It also\nplays a crucial part, along with the\nenvir onment, in deter mining the way the cell\nwill develop and what for m it will exhibit at\nmaturity, by dir ecting the chemical activities\nof the cell.\nIn some or ganisms like bacteria, the\nnuclear r egion of the cell may be poorly\ndefined due to the absence of a nuclear\nmembrane. Such an undefined nuclear r egion\ncontaining only nucleic acids is called a\nnucleoid. Such or ganisms, whose cells lack\na nuclear membrane, ar e called prokaryotes\n(Pro = primitive or primary; karyote \u2248 karyon\n= nucleus). Or ganisms with cells having a\nnuclear membrane are called eukaryotes.\nProkaryotic cells (see Fig. 5.4) also lack\nmost of the other cytoplasmic organellespresent in eukaryotic cells. Many of the\nfunctions of such organelles are also\nperformed by poorly or ganised parts of the\ncytoplasm (see section 5.2.4). The chlor ophyll\nin photosynthetic pr okaryotic bacteria is\nassociated with membranous vesicles (bag\nlike structur es) but not with plastids as in\neukaryotic cells (see section 5.2.5).\nRibosomesPlasma\nmembrane\nCell wall\nNucleoid\nFig. 5.4:  Prokaryotic cell\n5.2.4 CYTOPLASM\nWhen we look at the temporary mounts of\nonion peel as well as human cheek cells, we\ncan see a lar ge region of each cell enclosed\nby the cell membrane. This r egion takes up\nvery little stain. It is called the cytoplasm.\nThe cytoplasm is the fluid content inside the\nplasma membrane. It also contains many\nspecialised cell or ganelles. Each of these\norganelles per forms a specific function for the\ncell.\nCell or ganelles ar e enclosed by\nmembranes. In pr okaryotes, beside the\nabsence of a defined nuclear r egion, the\nmembrane-bound cell or ganelles ar e also\nabsent. On the other hand, the eukaryotic\ncells have nuclear membrane as well as\nmembrane-enclosed organelles.\nThe significance of membranes can be\nillustrated with the example of viruses.\nViruses lack any membranes and hence do\nnot show characteristics of life until they enter\na living body and use its cell machinery to\nmultiply.\n2024-25\n\nTHE FUNDAMENT AL UNIT OF LIFE 55uestion\n1.Fill in the gaps in the following\ntable illustrating dif ferences\nbetween pr okaryotic and\neukaryotic cells.\nProkaryotic Cell Eukaryotic Cell\n1.Size : generally 1.Size: generally\nsmall ( 1-10 \u00b5m) large ( 5-100 \u00b5m)\n1 \u00b5m = 10\u20136 m\n2.Nuclear r egion: 2.Nuclear r egion:\n_______________ well defined  and\n_______________ surrounded by a\nand known as__ nuclear membrane\n3.Chromosome: 3.More than one\nsingle chromosome\n4.Membrane-bound 4._______________\ncell or ganelles _______________\nabsent _______________\n5.2.5 CELL ORGANELLES\nEvery cell has a membrane ar ound it to keep\nits own contents separate fr om the exter nal\nenvir onment. Lar ge and complex cells,\nincluding cells from multicellular or ganisms,\nneed a lot of chemical activities to support\ntheir complicated structur e and function. T o\nkeep these activities of dif ferent kinds\nseparate fr om each other , these cells use\nmembrane-bound little structures (or\n\u2018organelles\u2019) within themselves. This is one of\nthe featur es of the eukaryotic cells that\ndistinguish them fr om pr okaryotic cells. Some\nof these or ganelles ar e visible only with an\nelectr on microscope.\nWe have talked about the nucleus in a\nprevious section. Some important examples\nof cell or ganelles which we will discuss now\nare: endoplasmic r eticulum, Golgi apparatus,\nlysosomes, mitochondria and plastids. They\nare important because they carry out some\nvery crucial functions in cells.5.2.5 ( i) ENDOPLASMIC  RETICULUM  (ER)\nThe endoplasmic r eticulum (ER) is a lar ge\nnetwork of membrane-bound tubes and\nsheets. It looks like long tubules or r ound or\noblong bags (vesicles). The ER membrane is\nsimilar in structur e to the plasma membrane.\nThere are two types of ER\u2013 r ough endoplasmic\nreticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic\nreticulum (SER). RER looks rough under a\nmicroscope because it has particles called\nribosomes attached to its sur face. The\nribosomes, which ar e present in all active\ncells, ar e the sites of protein manufactur e.\nThe manufactur ed pr oteins ar e then sent to\nvarious places in the cell depending on need,\nusing the ER. The SER helps in the\nmanufactur e of fat molecules, or lipids,\nimportant for cell function. Some of these\nproteins and lipids help in building the cell\nmembrane. This pr ocess is known as\nmembrane biogenesis. Some other pr oteins\nand lipids function as enzymes and\nhormones. Although the ER varies greatly in\nappearance in different cells, it always forms a\nnetwork system.Q\nFig. 5.5:  Animal cell\nThus, one function of the ER is to serve as\nchannels for the transport of materials\n(especially proteins) between various r egions\nof the cytoplasm or between the cytoplasm\nand the nucleus. The ER also functions as a\ncytoplasmic framework pr oviding a sur face\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 56Camillo Golgi was born at\nCorteno near Brescia in\n1843. He studied\nmedicine at the University\nof Pavia. After graduating\nin 1865, he continued to\nwork in Pavia at the\nHospital of St. Matteo. At\nthat time most of his\ninvestigations were\nconcerned with the nervous system, In 1872\nhe accepted the post of Chief Medical Officer\nat the Hospital for the Chronically Sick at\nAbbiategrasso.  He first started his\ninvestigations into the nervous system in a\nlittle kitchen of this hospital, which he had\nconverted into a laboratory. However , the\nwork of greatest importance, which Golgi\ncarried out was a revolutionary method of\nstaining individual nerve and cell structures.\nThis method is referred to as the \u2018black\nreaction\u2019. This method uses a weak solution\nof silver nitrate and is particularly valuable\nin tracing the processes and most delicate\nramifications of cells.  All through his life,\nhe continued to work on these lines,\nmodifying and improving this technique.\nGolgi received the highest honours and\nawards in recognition of his work. He shared\nthe Nobel prize in 1906 with Santiago\nRamony  Cajal for their work on the structure\nof the nervous system.\n5.2.5 ( iii) LYSOSOMES\nStructurally, lysosomes are membrane-bound\nsacs filled with digestive enzymes. These\nenzymes ar e made by RER. L ysosomes are a\nkind of waste disposal system of the cell. These\nhelp to keep the cell clean by digesting any\nforeign material as well as worn-out cell\norganelles. Foreign materials entering the cell,\nsuch as bacteria or food, as well as old\norganelles end up in the lysosomes, which\nbreak complex substances into simpler\nsubstances. L ysosomes ar e able to do this\nbecause they contain powerful digestive\nenzymes capable of breaking down all organic\nmaterial. During the disturbance in cellular\nmetabolism,  for example, when the cell getsFig. 5.6:  Plant cell\nfor some of the biochemical activities of the\ncell. In the liver cells of the group of animals\ncalled vertebrates (see Chapter 7), SER plays\na crucial role in detoxifying many poisons\nand drugs.\n5.2.5 ( ii) GOLGI APPARATUS\nThe Golgi apparatus, first described by\nCamillo Golgi, consists of a system of\nmembrane-bound vesicles (flattened sacs)\narranged approximately parallel to each other\nin stacks called cisterns. These membranes\noften have connections with the membranes\nof ER and therefore constitute another portion\nof a complex cellular membrane system.\nThe material synthesised near the ER is\npackaged and dispatched to various tar gets\ninside and outside the cell thr ough the Golgi\napparatus. Its functions include the storage,\nmodification and packaging of pr oducts in\nvesicles. In some cases, complex sugars may\nbe made from simple sugars in the Golgi\napparatus. The Golgi apparatus is also\ninvolved in the formation of lysosomes [see\n5.2.5 (iii)].\n2024-25\n\nTHE FUNDAMENT AL UNIT OF LIFE 57damaged, lysosomes may burst and the\nenzymes digest their own cell. Therefore,\nlysosomes are also known as the \u2018suicide bags\u2019\nof a cell.\n5.2.5 ( iv) MITOCHONDRIA\nMitochondria are known as the powerhouses\nof the cell. Mitochondria have two membrane\ncoverings. The outer membrane is porous\nwhile the inner membrane is deeply folded.\nThese folds increase surface area for ATP-\ngenerating chemical reactions. The energy\nrequired for various chemical activities needed\nfor life is released by mitochondria in the form\nof ATP (Adenosine triphopshate) molecules.\nATP is known as the energy currency of the\ncell. The body uses energy stored in ATP for\nmaking new chemical compounds and for\nmechanical work.\nMitochondria are strange organelles in the\nsense that they have their own DNA and\nribosomes. Therefore, mitochondria are able\nto make some of their own proteins.\n5.2.5 ( V) PLASTIDS\nPlastids are present only in plant cells. There\nare two types of plastids \u2013 chromoplasts\n(coloured plastids) and leucoplasts (white or\ncolourless plastids). Chromoplasts containing\nthe pigment chlorophyll are known as\nchloroplasts. Chloroplasts are important for\nphotosynthesis in plants. Chloroplasts also\ncontain various yellow or orange pigments in\naddition to chlorophyll. Leucoplasts are\nprimarily organelles in which materials such\nas starch, oils and protein granules are stored.\nThe internal organisation of the Ch loroplast\nconsists of numerous membrane layers\nembedded in a material called the stroma. These\nare similar to mitochondria in external\nstructure. Like the mitochondria, plastids also\nhave their own DNA and ribosomes.\n5.2.5 ( vi) VACUOLES\nVacuoles are storage sacs for solid or liquid\ncontents. V acuoles are small sized in animal\ncells while plant cells have very large vacuoles .\nThe central vacuole of some plant cells may\noccupy 50-90% of the cell volume.In plant cells vacuoles are full of cell sap\nand provide turgidity and rigidity to the cell.\nMany substances of importance in the life of\nthe plant cell are stored in vacuoles. These\ninclude amino acids, sugars, various organic\nacids and some proteins. In single-celled\norganisms like Amoeba , the food vacuole\ncontains the food items that the Amoeba\n has\nconsumed. In some unicellular organisms,\nspecialised vacuoles also play important roles\nin expelling excess water and some wastes\nfrom the cell.\nuestions\n1.Can you name the two organelles\nwe have studied that contain\ntheir own genetic material?\n2.If the organisation of a cell is\ndestr oyed due to some physical\nor chemical influence, what will\nhappen?\n3.Why are lysosomes known as\nsuicide bags?\n4.Wher e are proteins synthesised\ninside the cell?\nEach cell thus acquires its structure and\nability to function because of the organisation\nof its membrane and organelles in specific\nways. The cell thus has a basic structural\norganisation. This helps the cells to perform\nfunctions like respiration, obtaining nutrition,\nand clearing of waste material, or forming\nnew proteins.\nThus, the cell is the fundamental structural\nunit of living organisms. It is also the basic\nfunctional unit of life.\nCell Division\nNew cells are formed in organisms in order to\ngrow, to replace old, dead and injured cells,\nand to form gametes required for\nreproduction. The process by which new cells\nare made is called cell division. There are two\nmain types of cell division: mitosis\nand meiosis.\nThe process of cell division by which most\nof the cells divide for growth is called mitosis.\nIn this process, each cell called mother cellQ\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 58What\nyou have\nlearnt\n\u2022 The fundamental organisational unit of life is the cell.\n\u2022 Cells are enclosed by a plasma membrane composed of lipids\nand proteins.\n\u2022 The cell membrane is an active part of the cell. It regulates\nthe movement of materials between the ordered interior of\nthe cell and the outer environment.\n\u2022 In plant cells, a cell wall composed mainly of cellulose is\nlocated outside the cell membrane.\n\u2022 The presence of the cell wall enables the cells of plants,\nfungi and bacteria to exist in hypotonic media without\nbursting.\n\u2022 The nucleus in eukaryotes is separated from the cytoplasm\nby double-layered membrane and it directs the life processes\nof the cell.\n\u2022 The ER functions both as a passageway for intracellular\ntransport and as a manufacturing surface.\n\u2022 The Golgi apparatus consists of stacks of membrane-bound\nvesicles that function in the storage, modification and\npackaging of substances manufactured in the cell.\n\u2022 Most plant cells have large membranous organelles called\nplastids, which are of two types\u2014chromoplasts and\nleucoplasts.\nFig. 5.7: Mitosis Fig. 5.8:  Meiosis\ndivides to form two identical daughter cells\n(Fig. 5.7). The daughter cells have the same\nnumber of chromosomes as mother cell. It\nhelps in growth and repair of tissues\nin organisms.\nSpecific cells of reproductive organs or tissues\nin animals and plants divide to form gametes,\nwhich after fertilisation give rise to offspring.They divide by a different process called\nmeiosis which involves two consecutive\ndivisions. When a cell divides by meiosis it\nproduces four new cells instead of just two (Fig.\n5.8). The new cells only have half the number\nof chromosomes than that of the mother cells.\nCan you think as to why the chromosome\nnumber has reduced to half in daughter cells?\n2024-25\n\nTHE FUNDAMENT AL UNIT OF LIFE 59\u2022 Chromoplasts that contain chlorophyll are called chloroplasts\nand they perform photosynthesis.\n\u2022 The primary function of leucoplasts is storage.\n\u2022 Most mature plant cells have a large central vacuole that\nhelps to maintain the turgidity of the cell and stores\nimportant substances including wastes.\n\u2022 Prokaryotic cells have no membrane-bound organelles, their\nchromosomes are composed of only nucleic acid, and they\nhave only very small ribosomes as organelles.\n\u2022 Cells in organisms divide for growth of body, for repalcing\ndead cells, and for forming gametes for reproduction.\nExercises\n1.Make a comparison and write down ways in which plant\ncells are different from animal cells.\n2.How is a prokaryotic cell different from a eukaryotic cell?\n3.What would happen if the plasma membrane ruptures or\nbreaks down?\n4.What would happen to the life of a cell if there was no Golgi\napparatus?\n5.Which organelle is known as the powerhouse of the cell?

            "text": "In the pr evious chapter , we described the\nmotion of an object along a straight line in\nterms of its position, velocity and acceleration.\nWe saw that such a motion can be unifor m\nor non-unifor m. W e have not yet discovered\nwhat causes the motion. Why does the speed\nof an object change with time? Do all motions\nrequir e a cause? If so, what is the natur e of\nthis cause? In this chapter we shall make an\nattempt to quench all such curiosities.\nFor many centuries, the pr oblem of\nmotion and its causes had puzzled scientists\nand philosophers. A ball on the gr ound, when\ngiven a small hit, does not move for ever. Such\nobservations suggest that rest is the \u201cnatural\nstate\u201d of an object. This r emained the belief\nuntil Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton\ndeveloped an entir ely dif ferent appr oach to\nunderstand motion.In our everyday life we observe that some\neffort is r equir ed to put a stationary object\ninto motion or to stop a moving object. W e\nordinarily experience this as a muscular ef fort\nand say that we must push or hit or pull on\nan object to change its state of motion. The\nconcept of for ce is based on this push, hit or\npull. Let us now ponder about a \u2018for ce\u2019. What\nis it? In fact, no one has seen, tasted or felt a\nforce. However , we always see or feel the ef fect\nof a for\nce. It can only be explained by\ndescribing what happens when a for ce is\napplied to an object. Pushing, hitting and\npulling of objects ar e all ways of bringing\nobjects in motion (Fig. 8.1). They move because\nwe make a force act on them.\nFrom your studies in earlier classes, you\nare also familiar with the fact that a for ce can\nbe used to change the magnitude of velocity\nof an object (that is, to make the object move\nfaster or slower) or to change its dir ection of\nmotion. W e also know that a for ce can change\nthe shape and size of objects (Fig. 8.2).\n(a) The tr olley moves along the\ndirection we push it.\n(c) The hockey stick hits the ball forwar d(b) The drawer is pulled.\nFig. 8.1:     Pushing, pulling, or hitting objects change\ntheir state of motion.(a)\n(b)\nFig. 8.2: (a) A spring expands on application of force;\n(b) A spherical rubber ball becomes oblong\n    as we apply force on it.8\nFFF\nFFORCE ORCEORCE ORCEORCE     AND ANDANDANDAND L  L L  L LAWS AWSAWS AWSAWS     OF OFOF OFOF M  M M  M MOTION OTIONOTION OTIONOTIONChapter\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 88box with a small force, the box does not move\nbecause of friction acting in a dir ection\nopposite to the push [Fig. 8.4(a)]. This friction\nforce arises between two sur faces in contact;\nin this case, between the bottom of the box\nand floor\u2019s r ough sur face. It balances the\npushing force and ther\nefore the box does not\nmove. In Fig. 8.4(b), the children push the box\nharder but the box still does not move. This is\nbecause the friction force still balances the\npushing force. If the children push the box\nharder still, the pushing force becomes bigger\nthan the friction force [Fig. 8.4(c)].\nThere is an unbalanced force. So the box\nstarts moving.\nWhat happens when we ride a bicycle?\nWhen we stop pedalling, the bicycle begins\nto slow down. This is again because of the\nfriction for ces acting opposite to the dir ection\nof motion. In or der to keep the bicycle moving,\nwe have to start pedalling again. It thus\nappears that an  object maintains its motion\nunder the continuous application of an\nunbalanced for ce. However , it is quite\nincorr ect. An object moves with a unifor m\nvelocity when the for ces (pushing force and\nfrictional for ce) acting on the object ar e\nbalanced and ther e is no net exter nal for ce\non it. If an unbalanced for ce is applied on\nthe object, ther e will be a change either in its\nspeed or in the direction of its motion. Thus,\nto accelerate the motion of an object, an\nunbalanced for ce is r equir ed. And the change\nin its speed (or in the dir ection of motion)\nwould continue as long as this unbalanced\nforce is applied. However , if this for ce is8.1Balanced and Unbalanced\nForces\nFig. 8.3 shows a wooden block on a horizontal\ntable. Two strings X and Y are tied to the two\nopposite faces of the block as shown. If we\napply a for ce by pulling the string X, the block\nbegins to move to the right. Similarly, if we\npull the string Y , the block moves to the left.\nBut, if the block is pulled fr om both the sides\nwith equal for ces, the block will not move.\nSuch for ces are called balanced for ces and\ndo not change the state of r est or of motion of\nan object. Now, let us consider a situation in\nwhich two opposite for ces of dif ferent\nmagnitudes pull the block. In this case, the\nblock would begin to move in the dir ection of\nthe gr eater for ce. Thus, the two for ces ar e\nnot balanced and the unbalanced for ce acts\nin the dir ection the block moves. This\nsuggests that an unbalanced force acting on\nan object brings it in motion.\nFig. 8.3: Two forces acting on a wooden block\nWhat happens when some children try to\npush a box on a rough floor? If they push the\n(a) (b) (c)\nFig. 8.4\n2024-25\n\nFORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION 89removed completely, the object would continue\nto move with the velocity it has acquired till\nthen.\n8.2First Law of Motion\nBy observing the motion of objects on an\ninclined plane Galileo deduced that objects\nmove with a constant speed when no for ce\nacts on them. He observed that when a marble\nrolls down an inclined plane, its velocity\nincreases [Fig. 8.5(a)]. In the next chapter , you\nwill learn that the marble falls under the\nunbalanced force of gravity as it r olls down\nand attains a definite velocity by the time it\nreaches the bottom. Its velocity decreases\nwhen it climbs up as shown in Fig. 8.5(b).\nFig. 8.5(c) shows a marble resting on an ideal\nfrictionless plane inclined on both sides.\nGalileo ar gued that when the marble is\nreleased fr om left, it would r oll down the slope\nand go up on the opposite side to the same\nheight fr om which it was r eleased. If the\ninclinations of the planes on both sides ar e\nequal then the marble will climb the same\ndistance that it cover ed while r\nolling down. If\nthe angle of inclination of the right-side plane\nwere gradually decr eased, then the marble\nwould travel further distances till it r eaches\nthe original height. If the right-side plane wer e\nultimately made horizontal (that is, the slope\nis reduced to zer o), the marble would continue\nto travel for ever trying to r each the same\nheight that it was r eleased fr om. The\nunbalanced forces on the marble in this case\nare zero. It thus suggests that an unbalanced\n(exter nal) for ce is r equir ed to change the\nmotion of the marble but no net for ce is\nneeded to sustain the unifor m motion of the\nmarble.  In practical situations it is dif ficult\nto achieve a zer o unbalanced for ce. This is\nbecause of the presence of the frictional for ce\nacting opposite to the dir ection of motion.\nThus, in practice the marble stops after\ntravelling some distance. The ef fect of the\nfrictional for ce may be minimised by using a\nsmooth marble and a smooth plane and\nproviding a lubricant on top of the planes.Fig. 8.5: (a) the downward motion; (b) the upward\nmotion of a marble on an inclined plane;\nand (c) on a double inclined plane.\nNewton further studied Galileo\u2019s ideas on\nforce and motion and pr esented thr ee\nfundamental laws that gover n the motion of\nobjects. These thr ee laws ar e known as\nNewton\u2019s laws of motion. The first law of\nmotion is stated as:\nAn object r emains in a state of r est or of\nunifor m motion in a straight line unless\ncompelled to change that state by an\napplied force.\nIn other words, all objects resist a change\nin their state of motion . In a qualitative way,\nthe tendency of undisturbed objects to stay\nat rest or to keep moving with the same\nvelocity is called inertia. This is why, the first\nlaw of motion is also known as the law\nof inertia.\nCertain experiences that we come across\nwhile travelling in a motor car can be\nexplained on the basis of the law of inertia.\nWe tend to r emain at rest with r espect to the\nseat until the driver applies a braking for ce\nto stop the motor car. With the application of\nbrakes, the car slows down but our body\ntends to continue in the same state of motion\nbecause of its inertia. A sudden application of\nbrakes may thus cause injury to us by impact\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 90or collision with the panels in front. Safety belts\nare worn to prevent such accidents. Safety belts\nexert a force on our body to make the forward\nmotion slower . An opposite experience is\nencountered when we are standing in a bus\nand the bus begins to move suddenly. Now\nwe tend to fall backwards. This is because the\nsudden start of the bus brings motion to the\nbus as well as to our feet in contact with the\nfloor of the bus. But the rest of our body\nopposes this motion because of its inertia.\nWhen a motorcar makes a sharp turn at a\nhigh speed, we tend to get thrown to one side.\nThis can again be explained on the basis of\nthe law of inertia. W e tend to continue in our\nstraight-line motion. When an unbalanced\nforce is applied by the engine to change the\ndirection of motion of the motor car, we slip to\none side of the seat due to the inertia of\nour body.\nThe fact that a body will remain at rest\nunless acted upon by an unbalanced for ce\ncan be illustrated through the\nfollowing activities:\nActivity ______________ 8.1\n\u2022Make a pile of similar carom coins on\na table, as shown in Fig. 8.6.\n\u2022Attempt  a sharp horizontal hit at the\nbottom of the pile using another car om\ncoin or the striker . If the hit is str ong\nenough, the bottom coin moves out\nquickly. Once the lowest coin is\nremoved, the inertia of the other coins\nmakes them \u2018fall\u2019 vertically on the\ntable.Galileo Galilei was born\non 15 February 1564 in\nPisa, Italy. Galileo, right\nfrom his childhood, had\ninterest in mathematics\nand natural philosophy.\nBut his father\nVincenzo Galilei wanted\nhim to become a medical\ndoctor . Accor dingly,\nGalileo enr olled himself\nfor a medical degr ee at the\nUniversity of Pisa in 1581 which he never\ncompleted because of his r eal inter est in\nmathematics. In 1586, he wr ote his first\nscientific book \u2018The Little Balance [La\nBalancitta ]\u2019, in which he described\nArchimedes\u2019 method of finding the relative\ndensities (or specific gravities) of substances\nusing a balance. In 1589, in his series of\nessays \u2013 De Motu , he pr esented his theories\nabout falling objects using an inclined plane\nto slow down the rate of descent.\nIn 1592, he was appointed pr ofessor of\nmathematics at the University of Padua in\nthe Republic of V enice. Her e he continued his\nobservations on the theory of motion and\nthrough his study of inclined planes and the\npendulum, for mulated the corr ect law for\nunifor mly accelerated objects that the\ndistance the object moves is pr oportional to\nthe square of the time taken.\nGalileo was also a r emarkable craftsman.\nHe developed a series of telescopes whose\noptical per formance was much better than\nthat of other telescopes available during those\ndays. Ar ound 1640, he designed the first\npendulum clock. In his book \u2018Starry\nMessenger\u2019  on his astr onomical discoveries,\nGalileo claimed to have seen mountains on\nthe moon, the milky way made up of tiny\nstars, and four small bodies orbiting Jupiter .\nIn his books \n\u2018Discourse on Floating Bodies\u2019\nand \u2018Letters on the Sunspots\u2019 , he disclosed\nhis observations of sunspots.\nUsing his own telescopes and thr ough his\nobservations on Satur n and V enus, Galileo\nargued that all the planets must orbit the Sun\nand not the earth, contrary to what was\nbelieved at that time.\nGalileo Galilei\n(1564 \u2013 1642)\nFig. 8.6: Only the carom coin at the bottom of a\npile is removed when a fast moving carom\ncoin (or striker) hits it.\n2024-25\n\nFORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION 91five-rupees coin if we use a one-rupee coin, we\nfind that a lesser force is required to  perform\nthe activity. A force that is just enough to cause\na small cart to pick up a large velocity will\nproduce a negligible change in the motion of a\ntrain. This is because, in comparison to the\ncart the train has a much lesser tendency to\nchange its state of motion. Accordingly, we say\nthat the train has more inertia than the cart.\nClearly, heavier or more massive objects offer\nlarger inertia. Quantitatively, the inertia of an\nobject is measur ed by its mass. W e may thus\nrelate inertia and mass as follows:\nInertia is the natural tendency of an object to\nresist a change in its state of motion or of\nrest. The mass of an object is a measur e of\nits inertia.\nuestions\n1.Which of the following ha s more\ninertia: (a) a rubber ball and a\nstone of the same size? (b) a\nbicycle and a train?

If we do it fast then the\ncard shoots away, allowing the coin to\nfall vertically into the glass tumbler due\nto its inertia.\n\u2022The inertia of the coin tries to\nmaintain its state of rest even when\nthe card flows off.\nFig. 8.7:  When the card is flicked with the\nfinger the coin placed over it falls in the\ntumbler .\nActivity ______________ 8.3\n\u2022Place a water -filled tumbler on a tray.\n\u2022Hold the tray and tur n around as fast\nas you can.\n\u2022We observe that the water spills. Why?\nObserve that a gr oove is pr ovided in a\nsaucer for placing the tea cup. It pr events\nthe cup from toppling over in case of\nsudden jerks.\n8.3Inertia and Mass\nAll the examples and activities given so far\nillustrate that ther e is a r esistance of fered by\nan object to change its state of motion. If it is\nat rest it tends to r emain at r est; if it is moving\nit tends to keep moving. This pr operty of an\nobject is called its inertia. Do all bodies have\nthe same inertia? W e know that it is easier to\npush an empty box than a box full of books.\nSimilarly, if we kick a football it flies away.\nBut if we kick a stone of the same size with\nequal for ce, it har dly moves. W e may, in fact,\nget an injury in our foot while doing so!\nSimilarly, in activity 8.2, instead of aQ\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 92its velocity changes, that is, the object gets an\nacceleration. W e would now like to study how\nthe acceleration of an object depends on the\nforce applied to it and how we measure a force.\nLet us recount some observations from our\neveryday life. During the game of table tennis\nif the ball hits a player it does not hurt him.\nOn the other hand, when a fast moving cricket\nball hits a spectator , it may hurt him. A truck\nat rest does not require any attention when\nparked along a roadside. But a moving truck,\neven at speeds as low as 5 m s\u20131, may kill a\nperson standing in its path. A small mass,\nsuch as a bullet may kill a person when fired\nfrom a gun. These observations suggest that\nthe impact produced by the objects depends\non their mass and velocity. Similarly, if an\nobject is to be accelerated, we know that a\ngreater force is required to give a greater\nvelocity. In other words, there appears to exist\nsome quantity of importance that combines\nthe object\u2019s mass and its velocity. One such\nproperty called momentum was introduced by\nNewton. The momentum, p of an object is\ndefined as the product of its mass, m and\nvelocity, v. That is,\np = mv (8.1)\nMomentum has both direction and\nmagnitude. Its dir ection is the same as that\nof velocity, v . The SI unit of momentum is\nkilogram-metr e per second (kg m s-1). Since\nthe application of an unbalanced for ce brings\na change in the velocity of the object, it is\ntherefore clear that a for ce also pr oduces a\nchange of momentum.\nLet us consider a situation in which a car\nwith a dead battery is to be pushed along a\nstraight road to give it a speed of 1 m s-1, which\nis sufficient to start its engine. If one or two\npersons give a sudden push (unbalanced force)\nto it, it hardly starts. But a continuous push\nover some time results in a gradual acceleration\nof the car to this speed. It means that the change\nof momentum of the car is not only determined\nby the magnitude of the force but also by the\ntime during which the force is exerted. It may\nthen also be concluded that the force necessary\nto change the momentum of an object dependson the time rate at which the momentum is\nchanged.\nThe second law of motion states that the\nrate of change of momentum of an object is\nproportional to the applied unbalanced for ce\nin the direction of force.\n8.4.1 MATHEMATICAL  FORMULATION  OF\nSECOND  LAW OF MOTION\nSuppose an object of mass, m is moving along\na straight line with an initial velocity, u . It is\nunifor mly accelerated to velocity, v in time, t\nby the application of a constant for ce, F\nthroughout the time, t. The initial and final\nmomentum of the object will be, p1 = mu  and\np2 = mv  respectively.\nThe change in momentum \u221dp2 \u2013 p1\n\u221dmv \u2013 mu\n\u221dm \u00d7 (v \u2013 u).\nThe rate of change of momentum \u221d( )\u00d7 \u2212m v u\nt\nOr, the applied force,\nF \u221d ( )\u00d7 \u2212m v u\nt\n( )\u00d7 \u2212=km v u\ntF (8.2)\n=  kma  (8.3)\nHere a [ = (v \u2013 u)/ t ] is the acceleration,\nwhich is the rate of change of velocity. The\nquantity, k  is a constant of proportionality.\nThe SI units of mass and acceleration ar e kg\nand m s-2 respectively. The unit of for\nce is so\nchosen that the value of the constant, k\nbecomes one. For this, one unit of force is\ndefined as the amount that pr oduces an\nacceleration of 1 m s-2 in an object of 1 kg\nmass. That is,\n1 unit of force = k \u00d7 (1 kg) \u00d7 (1 m s-2).\nThus, the value of k becomes 1. From Eq. (8.3)\nF = ma (8.4)\nThe unit of force is kg m s-2 or newton,\nwhich has the symbol N. The second law of\n2024-25\n\nFORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION 93 9393 9393motion gives us a method to measure the force\nacting on an object as a product of its mass\nand acceleration.\nThe second law of motion is often seen in\naction in our everyday life. Have you noticed\nthat while catching a fast moving cricket ball,\na fielder in the ground gradually pulls his\nhands backwards with the moving ball? I n\ndoing so, the fielder increases the time during\nwhich the high velocity of the moving ball\ndecreases to zero. Thus, the acceleration of\nthe ball is decreased and therefore the impact\nof catching the fast moving ball (Fig. 8.8) is\nalso reduced. I f the ball is stopped suddenly\nthen its high velocity decreases to zero in a\nvery short interval of time. Thus, the rate of\nchange of momentum of the ball will be large.\nTherefore, a large force would have to be\napplied for holding the catch that may hurt\nthe palm of the fielder . In a high jump athletic\nevent, the athletes are made to fall either on\na cushioned bed or on a sand bed. This is to\nincrease the time of the athlete\u2019 s fall to stop\nafter making the jump. This decreases the rate\nof change of momentum and hence the force.\nTry to ponder how a karate player breaks a\nslab of ice with a single blow.The first law of motion can be\nmathematically stated from the mathematical\nexpression for the second law of motion. Eq.\n(8.4) is\nF = ma\nor F( )\u2212=m v u\nt(8.5)\nor Ft = mv \u2013 mu\nThat is, when F = 0, v = u for whatever time,\nt is taken. This means that the object will\ncontinue moving with uniform velocity , u\nthroughout the time, t. If u is zero then \nv will\nalso be zero. That is, the object will remain\nat rest.\nExampl ExamplExampl ExamplExampl e ee ee     8.1 8.18.1 8.18.1 A constant force acts on an\nobject of mass 5 kg for a duration of\n2 s.

(8.5) as\n= +Ftv u\nm\nOn substituting the values of u, F, m and\nt, we get the final velocity,\nv = 13 m s-1.\n Fig. 8.8: Fig. 8.8:Fig. 8.8: Fig. 8.8:Fig. 8.8: A fielder pulls his hands gradually with the\nmoving ball while holding a catch.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 94Exampl e 8.2 Which would require a\ngreater force \u2013\u2013 accelerating a 2 kg mass\nat 5 m s\u20132 or a 4 kg mass at 2 m s-2 ?\nSolution:\nFrom Eq. (8.4), we have F = ma.\nHere we have m1 = 2 kg; a1 = 5 m s-2\nand m2 = 4 kg; a2 = 2 m s-2.\nThus,  F1 = m1a1 = 2 kg \u00d7 5 m s-2 = 10 N;\nand F2  =  m2a2  = 4 kg \n\u00d7 2 m s-2 = 8 N.\n\u21d2 F1 > F2.\nThus, accelerating a 2 kg mass at\n5 m s-2 would r equir e a gr eater for ce.\nExampl e 8.3 A motorcar is moving with a\nvelocity of 108 km/h and it takes 4 s to\nstop after the brakes ar e applied.\nCalculate the force exerted by the\nbrakes on the motor car if its mass along\nwith the passengers is 1000 kg.\nSolution:\nThe initial velocity of the motorcar\nu = 108 km/h\n= 108 \u00d7 1000 m/(60 \u00d7 60 s)\n= 30 m s-1\nand the final velocity of the motor car\nv = 0 m s-1.\nThe total mass of the motor\ncar along\nwith its passengers = 1000 kg and the\ntime taken to stop the motor car, t = 4 s.\nFrom Eq. (8.5) we have the magnitude\nof the for ce (F) applied by the brakes as\nm(v \u2013 u)/t .\nOn substituting the values, we get\nF= 1000 kg \u00d7 (0 \u2013 30) m s-1/4 s\n= \u2013 7500 kg m s-2 or \u2013 7500 N.\nThe negative sign tells us that the force\nexerted by the brakes is opposite to the\ndirection of motion of the motor car.\nExampl e 8.4 A force of 5 N gives a mass\nm1, an acceleration of 10 m s\u20132 and a\nmass m2, an acceleration of 20 m s-2.\nWhat acceleration would it give if both\nthe masses wer e tied together?Solution:\nFrom Eq. (8.4) we have m1 = F/a1; and\nm2 = F/a2. Here, a1 = 10 m s-2;\na2 = 20 m s-2 and F = 5 N.\nThus,  m1 = 5 N/10 m s-2 = 0.50 kg; and\nm2 = 5 N/20 m s-2 = 0.25 kg.\nIf the two masses wer e tied together ,\nthe total mass, m would be\nm = 0.50 kg + 0.25 kg = 0.75 kg.\nThe acceleration, a produced in the\ncombined mass by the 5 N for ce would\nbe, a = F/m = 5 N/0.75 kg = 6.67 m s-2.\nExampl e 8.5 The velocity-time graph of a\nball of mass 20 g moving along a\nstraight line on a long table is given in\nFig. 8.9.\nFig. 8.9\nHow much force does the table exert on\nthe ball to bring it to rest?\nSolution:\nThe initial velocity of the ball is 20 cm s-1.\nDue to the friction al force exerted by the\ntable, the velocity of the ball decr eases\ndown to zer o in 10 s. Thus , u = 20 cm s\u20131;\nv = 0 cm s-1 and t = 10 s. Since the\nvelocity-time graph is a straight line, it is\nclear that the ball moves with a constant\naccelerat ion. The acceleration a is\n\u2212=v ua\nt\n= (0 cm s-1 \u2013 20 cm s-1)/10 s\n= \u20132 cm s-2 = \u20130.02 m s-2.\n2024-25\n\nFORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION 95The force exerted on the ball F is,\nF = ma = (20/1000) kg \u00d7 (\u2013 0.02 m s-2)\n   = \u2013 0.0004 N.\nThe negative sign implies that the\nfrictional force exerted by the table is\nopposite to the dir\nection of motion of\nthe ball.\n8.5Third Law of Motion\nThe first two laws of motion tell us how an\napplied for ce changes the motion and pr ovide\nus with a method of deter mining the for ce.\nThe thir d law of motion states that when one\nobject exerts a force on another object, the\nsecond object instantaneously exerts a for ce\nback on the first. These two forces ar e always\nequal in magnitude but opposite in dir ection.\nThese for ces act on dif ferent objects and never\non the same object. In the game of football\nsometimes we, while looking at the football\nand trying to kick it with a gr eater for ce,\ncollide with a player of the opposite team.\nBoth feel hurt because each applies a for ce\nto the other . In other words, ther e is a pair of\nforces and not just one for ce. The two\nopposing for ces ar e also known as action and\nreaction for ces.\nLet us consider two spring balances\nconnected together as shown in Fig. 8.10. The\nfixed end of balance B is attached with a rigid\nsupport, like a wall. When a for ce is applied\nthrough the fr ee end of spring balance A, it is\nobserved that both the spring balances show\nthe same r eadings on their scales. It means\nthat the for ce exerted by spring balance A on\nbalance B is equal but opposite in dir ection\nto the for ce exerted by the balance B on\nbalance A. Any of these two forces can be called\nas action  and the other as reaction . This gives\nus an alternative statement of the third law of\nmotion i.e., to every action there is an equal\nand opposite r eaction. However , it must be\nremembered that the action and reaction\nalways act on two different objects,\nsimultaneously.Fig. 8.10: Action and reaction forces are equal and\nopposite.\nSuppose you are standing at rest and\nintend to start walking on a r oad. Y ou must\naccelerate, and this r equir es a for ce in\naccor dance with the second law of motion.\nWhich is this for ce? Is it the muscular ef fort\nyou exert on the r oad? Is it in the dir ection\nwe intend to move? No, you push the r oad\nbelow backwar ds. The r oad exerts an equal\nand opposite force on your feet to make you\nmove forward.\nIt is important to note that even though\nthe action and r eaction for ces ar e always\nequal in magnitude, these for ces may not\nproduce accelerations of equal magnitudes.\nThis is because each for ce acts on a dif ferent\nobject that may have a dif fer\nent mass.\nWhen a gun is fir ed, it exerts a forwar d\nforce on the bullet. The bullet exerts an equal\nand opposite force on the gun. This results in\nthe recoil of the gun (Fig. 8.11). Since the gun\nhas a much greater mass than the bullet, the\nacceleration of the gun is much less than the\nacceleration of the bullet. The third law of\nmotion can also be illustrated when a sailor\njumps out of a rowing boat. As the sailor\njumps forward, the force on the boat moves it\nbackwards (Fig. 8.12).\nFig. 8.11: A forward force on the bullet and recoil\nof the gun.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 96What\nyou have\nlearnt\n\u2022 First law of motion: An object continues to be in a state of\nrest or of uniform motion along a straight line unless acted\nupon by an unbalanced force.\n\u2022 The natural tendency of objects to resist a change in their\nstate of rest or of uniform motion is called inertia.\n\u2022 The mass of an object is a measure of its inertia. Its SI unit\nis kilogram (kg).\n\u2022 Force of friction always opposes motion of objects.\n\u2022 Second law of motion: The rate of change of momentum of\nan object is proportional to the applied unbalanced force in\nthe direction of the force.Activity ______________ 8.4\n\u2022Request two children to stand on two\nseparate carts as shown in Fig. 8.13.\n\u2022Give them a bag full of sand or some\nother heavy object. Ask them to play a\ngame of catch with the bag.\n\u2022Does each of them experience an\ninstantaneous force as a result of\nthrowing the sand bag?\n\u2022You can paint a white line on\ncartwheels to observe the motion of the\ntwo carts when the children throw the\nbag towar ds each other .\nFig. 8.12:  As the sailor jumps in forward direction,\nthe boat moves backwar ds.\nFig. 8.13\nNow, place two children on one cart and\none on another cart. The second law of motion\ncan be seen, as this arrangement would show\ndifferent accelerations for the same force.\nThe cart shown in this activity can be\nconstructed by using a 12 mm or 18 mm thick\nplywood board of about 50 cm \u00d7 100 cm with\ntwo pairs of har d ball-bearing wheels (skate\nwheels ar e good to use). Skateboar ds ar e not\nas effective because it is dif ficult to maintain\nstraight-line motion.\n2024-25\n\nFORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION 97\u2022 The SI unit of force is kg m s\u20132. This is also known as newton\nand represented by the symbol N. A force of one newton\nproduces an acceleration of 1 m s\u20132 on an object of\nmass 1 kg.\n\u2022 The momentum of an object is the product of its mass and\nvelocity and has the same direction as that of the velocity.\nIts SI unit is kg m s\u20131.\n\u2022 Third law of motion: To every action, there is an equal and\nopposite reaction and they act on two different bodies.\nExercises\n1.An object experiences a net zero external unbalanced force.\nIs it possible for the object to be travelling with a non-zero\nvelocity?

W e have specified the\nposition of the school with r espect to the\nrailway station. In this example, the railway\nstation is the r eference point.

W e shall first lear n to\ndescribe this by an example. Consider the\nmotion of an object moving along a straight\npath. The object starts its jour ney fr om O\nwhich is tr eated as its r eference point\n(Fig. 7.1). Let A, B and C represent the position\nof the object at different instants. At first, the\nobject moves through C and B and reaches A.\nThen it moves back along the same path and\nreaches C through B.\nare used to describe the overall motion of an\nobject and to locate its final position with\nreference to its initial position at a given time.\nActivity ______________ 7.3\n\u2022Take a metre scale and a long rope.\n\u2022Walk from one cor ner of a basket-ball\ncourt to its oppposite cor ner along its\nsides.\n\u2022Measur e the distance cover ed by you\nand magnitude of the displacement.\n\u2022What dif ference would you notice\nbetween the two in this case?\nActivity ______________ 7.4\n\u2022Automobiles are fitted with a device\nthat shows the distance travelled. Such\na device is known as an odometer . A\ncar is driven fr om Bhubaneshwar to\nNew Delhi. The dif ference between the\nfinal r eading and the initial r eading of\nthe odometer is 1850 km.\n\u2022Find the magnitude of the displacement\nbetween Bhubaneshwar and New Delhi\nby using the Road Map of India.The total path length covered by the object\nis OA + AC, that is 60 km + 35 km = 95 km.\nThis is the distance cover ed by the object. T o\ndescribe distance we need to specify only the\nnumerical value and not the dir ection of\nmotion. Ther e are certain quantities which\nare described by specifying only their\nnumerical values. The numerical value of a\nphysical quantity is its magnitude. Fr om this\nexample, can you find out the distance of the\nfinal position C of the object fr om the initial\nposition O? This dif ference will give you the\nnumerical value of the displacement of the\nobject fr om O to C thr ough A. The shortest\ndistance measur ed from the initial to the final\nposition of an object is known as\nthe displacement.\nCan the magnitude of the displacement be\nequal to the distance travelled by an object?\nConsider the example given in (Fig. 7.1). For\nmotion of the object from O to A,  the distance\ncovered is 60 km  and the magnitude of\ndisplacement is also 60 km. During its motion\nfrom O to A and back to B, the distance coveredFig. 7.1:  Positions of an object on a straight line path= 60 km + 25 km = 85 km while the magnitude\nof displacement = 35 km. Thus, the magnitude\nof displacement (35 km) is not equal to the path\nlength (85 km). Further , we will notice that the\nmagnitude of the displacement for a course of\nmotion may be zero but the corresponding\ndistance covered is not zero. If we consider the\nobject to travel back to O, the final position\nconcides with the initial position, and therefore,\nthe displacement is zer o. However , the distance\ncovered in this journey is OA + AO = 60 km +\n60 km = 120 km.

Let it travel 5 m in the first second,\n5 m mor e in the next second , 5 m in the\nthird second  and 5 m in the fourth second .\nIn this case, the object covers 5 m in each\nsecond. As the object covers equal distances\nin equal intervals of time, it is said to be in\nunifor m motion. The time interval in this\nmotion should be small. In our day-to-day\nlife, we come acr oss motions wher e objects\ncover unequal distances in equal intervals\nof time, for example, when a car is moving\non a cr owded str eet or a person is jogging\nin a park. These ar e some instances of\nnon-unifor m motion.\nActivity ______________ 7.5\n\u2022The data regarding the motion of two\ndifferent objects A and B ar e given in\nTable 7.1.\n\u2022Examine them car efully and state\nwhether the motion of the objects is\nunifor m or non-unifor m.Q\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 7.2Table 7.1\nTime Distance Distance\ntravelled by travelled by\nobject A in m object  B in m\n9:30 am 10 12\n9:45 am 20 19\n10:00 am 30 23\n10:15 am 40 35\n10:30 am 50 37\n10:45 am 60 41\n11:00 am 70 44\n7.2Measuring the Rate of Motion\n2024-25\n\nMOTION 75Look at the situations given in Fig. 7.2. If\nthe bowling speed is 143 km h\u20131 in Fig. 7.2(a)\nwhat does it mean? What do you understand\nfrom the signboard in Fig. 7.2(b)?\nDifferent objects may take dif ferent\namounts of time to cover a given distance.\nSome of them move fast and some move\nslowly.  The rate at which objects move can\nbe dif ferent. Also, dif ferent objects can move\nat the same rate. One of the ways of\nmeasuring the rate of motion of an object is\nto find out the distance travelled by the object\nin unit time. This quantity is r eferred to as\nspeed. The SI unit of speed is metr e per\nsecond. This is r epresented by the symbol\nm s\u20131 or m/s. The other units of speed include\ncentimetr e per second (cm s\u20131) and kilometr e\nper hour (km h\u20131). To specify the speed of an\nobject, we r equir e only its magnitude. The\nspeed of an object need not be constant. In\nmost cases, objects will be in non-unifor m\nmotion. Ther efore, we describe the rate of\nmotion of such objects in ter ms of their\naverage speed. The average speed of an object\nis obtained by dividing the total distance\ntravelled by the total time taken. That is,\naverage speed =\n Total distance travelled\nTotal time taken\nIf an object travels a distance s in time t then\nits speed v is,\nv = s\nt(7.1)\nLet us understand this by an example. A\ncar travels a distance of 100 km in 2 h. Its\naverage speed is 50 km h\u20131. The car might\nnot have travelled at 50 km h\u20131 all the time.\nSometimes it might have travelled faster and\nsometimes slower than this.\nExample 7.1  An object travels 16 m in 4 s\nand then another 16 m in 2 s. What is\nthe average speed of the object?\nSolution:\nTotal distance travelled by the object =\n16 m + 16 m = 32 m\nTotal time taken = 4 s + 2 s = 6 sAverage speed =  Total distance travelled\nTotal time taken\n= 32 m\n6 s= 5.33 m s\u20131\nTherefore, the average speed of the object\nis 5.33 m s\u20131.\n7.2.1 SPEED WITH DIRECTION\nThe rate of motion of an object can be mor e\ncompr ehensive if we specify its dir ection of\nmotion along with its speed. The quantity that\nspecifies both these aspects is called velocity.\nVelocity is the speed of an object moving in a\ndefinite dir ection. The velocity of an object\ncan be unifor m or variable. It can be changed\nby changing the object\u2019s speed, dir ection of\nmotion or both. When an object is moving\nalong a straight line at a variable speed, we\ncan expr ess the magnitude of its rate of\nmotion in ter ms of average velocity.

For example, in the telecast of a\none-day cricket match, vertical bar graphs\nshow the run rate of a team in each over . As\nyou have studied in mathematics, a straight\nline graph helps in solving a linear equation\nhaving two variables.\nTo describe the motion of an object, we\ncan use line graphs. In this case, line graphs\nshow dependence of one physical quantity,\nsuch as distance or velocity, on another\nquantity, such as time.\n7.4.1 DISTANCE \u2013TIME GRAPHS\nThe change in the position of an object with\ntime can be represented on the distance-time\ngraph adopting a convenient scale of choice.\nIn this graph, time is taken along the x\u2013axis\nand distance is taken along the y-axis.\nDistance-time graphs can be employed under\nvarious conditions where objects move with\nuniform speed, non-uniform speed, remain\nat rest etc.\nFig. 7.3: Fig. 7.3:Fig. 7.3: Fig. 7.3:Fig. 7.3: Distance-time graph of an object moving\nwith unifor m speed\nWe know that when an object travels equal\ndistances in equal intervals of time, it moves\nwith uniform speed. This shows that thedistance travelled by the object is directly\nproportional to time taken. Thus, for uniform\nspeed, a graph of distance travelled against\ntime is a straight line, as shown in Fig. 7.3.\nThe portion OB of the graph shows that the\ndistance is increasing at a uniform rate. N ote\nthat, you can also use the term uniform\nvelocity in place of uniform spe ed if you take\nthe magnitude of displacement equal to the\ndistance travelled by the object along the\ny-axis.\nWe can use the distance-time graph to\ndetermine the spe ed of an object. T o do so,\nconsider a small part AB of the distance-time\ngraph shown in Fig 7.3. Draw a line parallel\nto the x-axis from point A and another line\nparallel to the y-axis from point B . These two\nlines me et each other at point C to form a\ntriangle ABC. Now, on the graph, AC  denotes\nthe time interval ( t2 \u2013 t1) while BC corresponds\nto the distance ( s2 \u2013 s1). We can se e from the\ngraph that as the object moves from the point\nA to B, it covers a distance ( s2 \u2013 s1) in time\n(t2 \u2013 t1). The spe ed, v of the object, therefore\ncan be represented as\n  = 2 1\n2 1\u2013\n\u2013s s\nt t(7.4)\nWe can also plot the distance-time graph\nfor accelerated motion. Table 7.2 shows the\ndistance travelled by a car in a time interval\nof two seconds.\nTable 7.2: Distance travelled by aTable 7.2: Distance travelled by aTable 7.2: Distance travelled by aTable 7.2: Distance travelled by aTable 7.2: Distance travelled by a\ncar at regular time intervalscar at regular time intervalscar at regular time intervalscar at regular time intervalscar at regular time intervals\nTime in secondsTime in secondsTime in secondsTime in secondsTime in seconds Distance in metresDistance in metresDistance in metresDistance in metresDistance in metres\n0 0\n2 1\n4 4\n6 9\n8 16\n10 25\n12 36v\n2024-25\n\nMOTION 79The distance-time graph for the motion\nof the car is shown in Fig. 7.4. Note that the\nshape of this graph is dif ferent fr om the earlier\ndistance-time graph (Fig. 7.3) for uniform\nmotion. The natur e of this graph shows non-\nlinear variation of the distance travelled by\nthe car with time. Thus, the graph shown in\nFig 7.4 represents motion with non-uniform\nspeed.\n7.4.2 V ELOCITY -TIME GRAPHS\nThe variation in velocity with time for an object\nmoving in a straight line can be represented\nby a velocity-time graph. In this graph, time is\nrepresented along the x-axis and the velocityFig. 7.4: Distance-time graph for a car moving with\nnon-unifor m speed\nFig. 7.5: Velocity-time graph for unifor m motion\nof a caris represented along the y-axis. If the object\nmoves at uniform velocity, the height of its\nvelocity-time graph will not change with time\n(Fig. 7.5). It will be a straight line parallel to\nthe x-axis. Fig. 7.5 shows the velocity-time\ngraph for a car moving with uniform velocity\nof 40 km h\u20131.\nWe know that the pr oduct of velocity and\ntime give displacement of an object moving\nwith unifor m velocity. The area enclosed by\nvelocity-time graph and the time axis will be\nequal to the magnitude of the displacement.\nTo know the distance moved by the car\nbetween time  t1 and t2 using Fig. 7.5, draw\nperpendiculars fr om the points corr esponding\nto the time t1 and t2 on the graph. The velocity\nof 40 km h\u20131 is represented by the height AC\nor BD and the time ( t2 \u2013 t1) is represented by\nthe length AB.\nSo, the distance s moved by the car in\ntime ( t2 \u2013 t1) can be expr essed as\ns=AC \u00d7 CD\n=[(40 km h\u20131) \u00d7 (t2 \u2013 t1) h]\n=40 (t2\u2013 t1) km\n=area of the r ectangle ABDC (shaded\nin Fig. 7.5).\nWe can also study about unifor mly\naccelerated motion by plotting its velocity\u2013\ntime graph. Consider a car being driven along\na straight r oad for testing its engine. Suppose\na person sitting next to the driver r ecords its\nvelocity after every 5 seconds by noting the\nreading of the speedometer of the car . The\nvelocity of the car , in km h\u20131 as well as in\nm s\u20131,  at dif fer\nent instants of time is shown\nin table 7.3.\nTable 7.3: Velocity of a car at\nregular instants of time\nTime Velocity of the car\n  (s) (m s\u20131) (km h\u20131)\n0 0 0\n5 2.5 9\n10 5.0 18\n15 7.5 27\n20 10.0 36\n25 12.5 45\n30 15.0 54\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 80In this case, the velocity-time graph for the\nmotion of the car is shown in Fig. 7.6. The\nnature of the graph shows that velocity\nchanges by equal amounts in equal intervals\nof time. Thus, for all unifor mly accelerated\nmotion, the velocity-time graph is a\nstraight line.\nFig. 7.6:  Velocity-time graph for a car moving with\nuniform accelerations.\nYou can also determine the distance\nmoved by the car fr om its velocity-time graph.\nThe area under the velocity-time graph gives\nthe distance (magnitude of displacement)\nmoved by the car in a given interval of time.\nIf the car would have been moving with\nunifor m velocity, the distance travelled by it\nwould be r epresented by the ar ea ABCD\nunder the graph (Fig. 7.6). Since the\nmagnitude of the velocity of the car is\nchanging due to acceleration, the distance s\ntravelled by the car will be given by the ar\nea\nABCDE under the velocity-time graph\n(Fig. 7.6).\nThat is,\ns=area ABCDE\n=area of the rectangle ABCD + area of\nthe triangle ADE\n=AB \u00d7 BC +  1\n2(AD \u00d7 DE)\nIn the case of non-unifor mly accelerated\nmotion, velocity-time graphs can have any\nshape.Fig. 7.7:  Velocity-time graphs of an object in non-\nunifor mly accelerated motion.\nFig. 7.7(a) shows a velocity-time graph that\nrepresents the motion of an object whose\nvelocity is decr easing with time while\nFig. 7.7 (b) shows the velocity-time graph\nrepresenting the non-unifor m variation of\nvelocity of the object with time.

The change in\nthe velocity could be due to change in its\nmagnitude or the direction of the motion or\nboth. Can you think of an example when an\nobject does not change its magnitude of\nvelocity but only its direction of motion?straight parts AB, BC, CD and DA of the track.\nIn order to keep himself on track, he quickly\nchanges his speed at the corners. How many\ntimes will the athlete have to change his\ndirection of motion, while he completes one\nround? It is clear that to move in a rectangular\ntrack once, he has to change his direction of\nmotion four times.\nNow, suppose instead of a rectangular\ntrack, the athlete is running along a\nhexagonal shaped path ABCDEF , as shown\nin Fig. 7.8(b). In this situation, the athlete will\nhave to change his direction six times while\nhe  completes one round. What if the track\nwas not a hexagon but a regular octagon,\nwith eight equal sides as shown by\nABCDEFGH in Fig. 7.8(c)?  It is observed that\nas the number of sides of the track increases\nthe athelete has to take turns more and more\noften. What would happen to the shape of the\ntrack as we go on increasing the number of\nsides indefinitely? If you do this you will\nnotice that the shape of the track approaches\nthe shape of a circle and the length of each of\nthe sides will decrease to a point. If the athlete\nmoves with a velocity of constant magnitude\nalong the circular path, the only change in\nhis velocity is due to the change in the\ndirection of motion. The motion of the athlete\nmoving along a circular path is, therefore, an\nexample of an accelerated moti on.\nWe know  that the cir cumfer ence of a cir cle\nof radius r is given by  \u03c02 r.

Move\nthe stone to describe a circular path\nwith constant speed by holding the\nthread at the other end, as shown in\nFig. 7.9.If you carefully note, on being released\nthe stone moves along a straight line\ntangential to the circular path. This is\nbecause once the stone is released, it\ncontinues to move along the direction it has\nbeen moving at that instant. This shows that\nthe direction of motion changed at every point\nwhen the stone was moving along the circular\npath.\nWhen an athlete throws a hammer or a\ndiscus in a sports meet, he/she holds the\nhammer or the discus in his/her hand and\ngives it a circular motion by rotating his/\nher own body. Once released in the desired\ndirection, the hammer or discus moves in\nthe direction in which it was moving at the\ntime it was released, just like the piece of\nstone in the activity described above. There\nare many more familiar examples of objects\nmoving under uniform circular motion,\nsuch as the motion of the moon and the\nearth, a satellite in a circular orbit around\nthe earth, a cyclist on a circular track at\nconstant speed and so on.\nWhat\nyou have\nlearnt\n\u2022 Motion is a change of position; it can be described in terms\nof the distance moved or the displacement.\n\u2022 The motion of an object could be uniform or non-uniform\ndepending on whether its velocity is constant or changing.\n\u2022 The speed of an object is the distance covered per unit time,\nand velocity is the displacement per unit time.\n\u2022 The acceleration of an object is the change in velocity per\nunit time.\n\u2022 Uniform and non-uniform motions of objects can be shown\nthrough graphs.\n\u2022 The motion of an object moving at uniform acceleration can\nbe described with the help of the following equations, namely\nv = u + at\ns = ut + \u00bd at2\n2as = v2 \u2013 u2Fig. 7.9: A stone describing a circular path with\na velocity of constant magnitude.\n\u2022Now, let the stone go by releasing the\nthread.\n\u2022Can you tell the direction in which\nthe stone moves after it is released?\n\u2022By repeating the activity for a few\ntimes and releasing the stone at\ndifferent positions of the circular\npath, check whether the direction in\nwhich the stone moves remains the\nsame or not.\n2024-25\n\nMOTION 85 8585 8585where u is initial velocity of the object, which moves with\nuniform acceleration  a for time t, v is its final velocity and\ns is the distance it travelled in time  t.\n\u2022 If an object moves in a circular path with uniform speed,\nits motion is called uniform circular motion.\nExercises\n1.An athlete completes one round of a circular track of\ndiameter 200 m in 40 s.

Living beings\nhave to per form several basic activities to\nsurvive.  W e call such activities \u2018life pr ocesses\u2019.\nThe ener gy for these pr ocesses comes fr om\nfood. W e need ener gy for other activities like\nplaying, singing, r eading, writing, thinking,\njumping, cycling and running.  Activities that\nare strenuous requir e mor e ener gy.\nAnimals too get engaged in activities.  For\nexample, they may jump and run.  They have\nto fight, move away fr om enemies, find food\nor find a safe place to live. Also, we engage\nsome animals to lift weights, carry loads, pull\ncarts or plough fields.  All such activities\nrequir e ener gy.\nThink of machines. List the machines that\nyou have come acr\noss. What do they need for\ntheir working? Why do some engines r equir e\nfuel like petr ol and diesel?  Why do living\nbeings and machines need energy?\n10.1Work\nWhat is work? There is a dif ference in the\nway we use the ter m \u2018work\u2019 in day-to-day life\nand the way we use it in science.  T o make\nthis point clear let us consider a few examples.\n10.1.1 NOT MUCH  \u2018WORK \u2019 IN SPITE OF\nWORKING  HARD !\nKamali is pr eparing for examinations. She\nspends lot of time in studies. She r eads books,draws diagrams, organises her thoughts,\ncollects question papers, attends classes,\ndiscusses pr oblems with her friends, and\nperforms experiments.  She expends a lot of\nenergy on these activities. In common\nparlance, she is \u2018working har d\u2019. All this \u2018har d\nwork\u2019 may involve very little \u2018work\u2019 if we go by\nthe scientific definition of work.\nYou ar e working har d to push a huge r ock.\nLet us say the r ock does not move despite all\nthe ef fort. Y ou get completely exhausted.\nHowever , you have not done any work on the\nrock as there is no displacement of the r ock.\nYou stand still for a few minutes with a\nheavy load on your head.   Y ou get tired. Y ou\nhave exerted yourself and have spent quite a\nbit of your energy. Ar e you doing work on the\nload?  The way we understand the ter m \u2018work\u2019\nin science, work is not done.\nYou climb up the steps of a stair case and\nreach the second floor of a building just to\nsee the landscape fr om ther e.  You may even\nclimb up a tall tr ee.  If we apply the scientific\ndefinition, these activities involve a lot of work.\nIn day-to-day life, we consider any useful\nphysical or mental labour as work. Activities\nlike playing in a field, talking with friends,\nhumming a tune, watching a movie, attending\na function ar e sometimes not consider ed to\nbe work.  What constitutes \u2018work\u2019 depends\non the way we define it. W e use and define\nthe ter m work dif ferently in science.  T o\nunderstand this let us do the following\nactivities:\nActivity _____________ 10.1\n\u2022We have discussed in the above\nparagraphs a number of activities\nwhich we nor mally consider to be work10\nW WW WWORK ORKORK ORKORK     AND ANDANDANDAND E  E E  E ENERGY NERGYNERGY NERGYNERGYChapter\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 114Activity _____________ 10.3\n\u2022Think of situations when the object\nis not displaced in spite of a force\nacting on it.\n\u2022Also think of situations when an object\ngets displaced in the absence of a for ce\nacting on it.\n\u2022List all the situations that you can\nthink of for each.\n\u2022Discuss with your friends whether\nwork is done in these situations.\n10.1.3 WORK DONE  BY A CONSTANT\nFORCE\nHow is work defined in science? T o\nunderstand this, we shall first consider the\ncase when the for ce is acting in the dir ection\nof displacement.\nLet a constant for ce, F act on an object.\nLet the object be displaced thr ough a\ndistance, \ns in the direction of the force (Fig.\n10.1). Let W be the work done. W e define work\nto be equal to the pr oduct of the for ce and\ndisplacement.\nWork done =force \u00d7 displacement\nW=F s  (10.1)in day-to-day life. For each of these\nactivities, ask the following questions\nand answer them:\n(i)What is the work being done on?\n(ii)What is happening to the object?\n(iii)Who (what) is doing the work?\n10.1.2 SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTION  OF WORK\nTo understand the way we view work and\ndefine work fr om the point of view of science,\nlet us consider some situations:\nPush a pebble lying on a sur face. The\npebble moves thr ough a distance. Y ou exerted\na for ce on the pebble and the pebble got\ndisplaced. In this situation work is done.\nA girl pulls a tr olley and the tr olley moves\nthrough a distance.  The girl has exerted a\nforce on the trolley and it is displaced.\nTherefor e, work is done.\nLift a book thr ough a height. T o do this\nyou must apply a for ce.  The book rises up.\nThere is a for ce applied on the book and the\nbook has moved.  Hence, work is done.\nA closer look at the above situations\nreveals that two conditions need to be\nsatisfied for work to be done: (i) a for ce should\nact on an object, and (ii) the object must be\ndisplaced.\nIf any one of the above conditions does\nnot exist, work is not done. This is the way\nwe view work in science.\nA bullock is pulling a cart.  The cart\nmoves. Ther e is a force on the cart and the\ncart has moved. Do you think that work is\ndone in this situation?\nActivity _____________ 10.2\n\u2022Think of some situations from your\ndaily life involving work.\n\u2022List them.\n\u2022Discuss with your friends whether\nwork is being done in each situation.\n\u2022Try to r eason out your response.\n\u2022If work is done, which is the for ce acting\non the object?\n\u2022What is the object on which the work\nis done?\n\u2022What happens to the object on which\nwork is done?Fig. 10.1\nThus, work done by a force acting on an\nobject is equal to the magnitude of the for ce\nmultiplied by the distance moved in the\ndirection of the for ce. W ork has only\nmagnitude and no dir ection.\nIn Eq. (10.1), if F = 1 N and s = 1 m then\nthe work done by the for ce will be 1 N m.\nHere the unit of work is newton metr e (N m)\nor joule  (J).  Thus 1 J is the amount of work\n2024-25\n\nWORK AND E NERGY 115done on an object when a for ce of 1 N\ndisplaces it by 1 m along the line of action of\nthe for ce.\nLook at Eq. (10.1) carefully.  What is the\nwork done when the for ce on the object is\nzero? What would be the work done when\nthe displacement of the object is zer o? Refer\nto the conditions that ar e to be satisfied to\nsay that work is done.\nExample  10.1 A force of 5 N is acting on\nan object. The object is displaced\nthrough 2 m in the direction of the force\n(Fig. 10.2). If the force acts on the object\nall through the displacement, then work\ndone is 5 N \u00d7  2 m  =10 N m or 10 J.Fig. 10.4\nConsider a situation in which an object is\nmoving with a uniform velocity along a\nparticular dir ection. Now a r etarding for ce, F,\nis applied in the opposite direction. That is,\nthe angle between the two directions is 180\u00ba.\nLet the object stop after a displacement s. In\nsuch a situation, the work done by the force,\nF is taken as negative and denoted by the\nminus sign. The work done by the force is\nF \u00d7\n (\u2013s) or (\u2013F \u00d7 s).\nIt is clear from the above discussion that\nthe work done by a for ce can be either positive\nor negative. T o understand this, let us do the\nfollowing activity:\nActivity _____________ 10.4\n\u2022Lift an object up. W ork is done by the\nforce exerted by you on the object.  The\nobject moves upwar ds. The for ce you\nexerted is in the dir ection of\ndisplacement. However , ther e is the\nforce of gravity acting on the object.\n\u2022Which one of these for ces is doing\npositive work?\n\u2022Which one is doing negative work?\n\u2022Give r easons.\nWork done is negative when the for ce acts\nopposite to the dir ection of displacement.\nWork done is positive when the for ce is in the\ndirection of displacement.\nExample  10.2  A porter lifts a luggage of\n15 kg from the ground and puts it on\nhis head 1.5 m above the ground.\nCalculate the work done by him on the\nluggage.\nSolution:\nMass of luggage, m = 15 kg and\ndisplacement, s  = 1.5 m.Fig. 10.2\nuestion\n1.A force of 7 N acts on an object.\nThe displacement is, say 8 m, in\nthe dir ection of the for ce\n(Fig. 10.3).  Let us take it that the\nforce acts on the object thr ough\nthe displacement. What is the\nwork done in this case?\nFig. 10.3\nConsider another situation in which the\nforce and the displacement are in the same\ndirection:  a baby pulling a toy car parallel to\nthe ground, as shown in Fig. 10.4.  The baby\nhas exerted a for ce in the dir ection of\ndisplacement of the car . In this situation, the\nwork done will be equal to the pr oduct of the\nforce and displacement. In such situations,\nthe work done by the force is taken as positive.Q\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 116raised hammer falls on a nail placed on a piece\nof wood, it drives the nail into the wood . We\nhave also observed children winding a toy\n(such as a toy car) and when the toy is placed\non the floor , it starts moving. When a balloon\nis filled with air and we press it we notice a\nchange in its shape. As long as we press it\ngently, it can come back to its original shape\nwhen the for ce is withdrawn. However , if we\npress the balloon hard, it can even explode\nproducing a blasting sound. In all these\nexamples, the objects  acquire, through\ndifferent means, the capability of doing work.\nAn object having a capability to do work is\nsaid to possess ener gy. The object which does\nthe work loses ener gy and the object on which\nthe work is done gains ener gy.\nHow does an object with ener gy do work?\nAn object that possesses ener gy can exert a\nforce on another object. When this happens,\nenergy is transferr ed from the for mer to the\nlatter . The second object may move as it\nreceives ener gy and ther efor\ne do some work.\nThus, the first object had a capacity  to do\nwork. This implies that any object that\npossesses ener gy can do work.\nThe energy possessed by a n object  is thus\nmeasur ed in  terms of  its  capacity of doing\nwork. The unit of ener gy is, ther efore, the same\nas that of work , that is, joule (J).  1 J is the\nenergy requir ed to do 1 joule of work.\nSometimes a larger unit of energy called kilo\njoule (kJ) is used. 1 kJ equals 1000 J.\n10.2.1 FORMS  OF ENERGY\nLuckily the world we live in provides energy in\nmany different forms.  The various forms\ninclude mechanical ener gy (potential energy\n+ kinetic ener gy), heat ener gy, chemical\nenergy, electrical ener gy and light energy.\nThink it over !\nHow do you know that some entity is a\nform of ener gy? Discuss with your friends\nand teachers.Work done, W = F \u00d7 s = mg \u00d7 s\n=15 kg \u00d7 10 m s-2 \u00d7 1.5 m\n=225 kg m s-2 m\n=225 N m =  225 J\nWork done is 225 J.\nuestions\n1.When do we say that work is\ndone?\n2.Write an expr ession for the work\ndone when a for ce is acting on\nan object in the direction of its\ndisplacement.\n3.Define 1 J  of work.\n4.A pair of bullocks exerts a for ce\nof 140 N on a plough.  The field\nbeing ploughed is 15 m long.\nHow much work is done in\nploughing the length of the field?\n10.2Energy\nLife is impossible without energy. The demand\nfor energy is ever incr easing.  Where do we\nget ener gy fr om? The Sun is the biggest\nnatural sour ce of ener gy to us. Many of our\nenergy sources ar e derived fr om the Sun.  W e\ncan also get energy fr om the nuclei of atoms,\nthe interior of the earth, and the tides.  Can\nyou think of other sour ces of ener gy?\nActivity _____________ 10.5\n\u2022A few sources of energy are listed\nabove. There are many other sources\nof energy. List them.\n\u2022Discuss in small gr oups how certain\nsources of ener gy ar e due to the Sun.\n\u2022Are ther e sour ces of ener gy which ar e\nnot due to the Sun?\nThe wor d ener gy is very often used in our\ndaily life, but in science we give it a definite\nand pr ecise meaning. Let us consider the\nfollowing examples: when a fast moving\ncricket ball hits a stationary wicket, the wicket\nis thr own away. Similarly, an object when\nraised to a certain height gets the capability\nto do work. Y ou must have seen that when aQ\n2024-25\n\nWORK AND E NERGY 117Fig. 10.5\n\u2022The trolley moves forward and hits the\nwooden block.\n\u2022Fix a stop on the table in such a\nmanner that the tr olley stops after\nhitting the block. The block gets\ndisplaced.\n\u2022Note down the displacement of the\nblock. This means work is done on the\nblock by the tr olley as the block has\ngained ener gy.\n\u2022From wher e does this energy come?\n\u2022Repeat this activity by incr easing the\nmass on the pan. In which case is the\ndisplacement mor e?\n\u2022In which case is the work done mor e?\n\u2022In this activity, the moving tr olley does\nwork and hence it possesses ener gy.\nA moving object can do work.  An object\nmoving faster can do mor e work than an\nidentical object moving r elatively slow. A\nmoving bullet, blowing wind, a r otating wheel,\na speeding stone can do work. How does a\nbullet pierce the tar get? How does the wind\nmove the blades of a windmill?  Objects in\nmotion possess ener\ngy. W e call this ener gy\nkinetic ener gy.\nA falling coconut, a speeding car , a rolling\nstone, a flying air craft, flowing water , blowing\nwind, a running athlete etc. possess kinetic\nenergy.  In short, kinetic ener gy is the energy\npossessed by an object due to its motion. The\nkinetic energy of an object increases with its\nspeed.\nHow much ener gy is possessed by a\nmoving body by virtue of its motion?  By\ndefinition, we say that the kinetic ener gy of a\nbody moving with a certain velocity is equal to\nthe work done on it to make it acquire\nthat velocity.10.2.2 KINETIC ENERGY\nActivity _____________ 10.6\n\u2022Take a heavy ball.

He also\nverified experimentally the law of\nconservation of ener gy and discover ed\nthe value of the mechanical equivalent\nof heat. The unit of ener gy and work\ncalled joule, is named after him.James Prescott Joule\n(1818 \u2013 1889)\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 118Let us now express the kinetic energy of\nan object in the form of an equation. Consider\nan object of mass, m moving with a unifor m\nvelocity, u. Let it now be displaced thr ough a\ndistance s when a constant for ce, F acts on it\nin the dir ection of its displacement.  From\nEq. (10.1), the work done, W is F s. The work\ndone on the object will cause a change in its\nvelocity. Let its velocity change from u to v.\nLet a be the acceleration produced.\nWe studied thr ee equations of motion. The\nrelation connecting the initial velocity ( u)\nand final velocity ( v) of an object moving\nwith a uniform acceleration a, and the\ndisplacement, s is\nv2 \u2013 u2 = 2a s\nThis gives\n2 2v \u2013 us =\n2a(10.2)\nFrom section 9.4, we know F = m a. Thus,\nusing (Eq. 10.2) in Eq. (10.1), we can write the\nwork done by the force, F  as\n\u00d7\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8ed \uf8f82 2v - uW = m a  \n2a\nor\n( )1\n22 2W = m v \u2013 u (10.3)\nIf the object is starting from its stationary\nposition, that is, u = 0, then\n1\n22W = m v (10.4)\nIt is clear that the work done is equal to the\nchange in the kinetic energy of an object.\nIf u = 0, the work done will be 1\n22m v.\nThus, the kinetic ener gy possessed by an\nobject of mass, m  and moving with a unifor m\nvelocity, v is\n1\n22\nkE = m v (10.5)\nExample 10.3  An object of mass 15 kg is\nmoving with a uniform velocity of              4\nm s\u20131.

This is because work is\ndone on it against gravity while it is being\nraised. The energy present in such an object\nis the gravitational potential energy.\nThe gravitational potential ener gy of an\nobject at a point above the gr ound is defined\nas the work done in raising it fr om the gr ound\nto that point against gravity.\nIt is easy to arrive at an expr ession for\nthe gravitational potential ener gy of an object\nat a height.\nFig. 10.7\nConsider an object of mass, m . Let it be\nraised thr ough a height, h from the gr ound.\nA force is r equir ed to do this. The minimum\nforce requir ed to raise the object is equal to\nthe weight of the object, mg. The object gains\nenergy equal to the work done on it.  Let the\nwork done on the object against gravity be\nW. That is,\nwork done, W=force \u00d7 displacement\n= mg \u00d7 h\n= mgh\nSince work done on the object is equal to\nmgh, an energy equal to mgh units is gained\nby the object. This is the potential energy ( EP)\nof the object.\nEp = mgh (10.6)\nMore to knowThe potential energy of an object at\na height depends on the ground level\nor the zero level you choose.  An\nobject in a given position can have a\ncertain potential energy with respect\nto one level and a different value of\npotential energy with respect to\nanother level.\nIt is useful to note that the work done by\ngravity depends on the difference in vertical\nheights of the initial and final positions of\nthe object and not on the path along which\nthe object is moved. Fig. 10.8 shows a case\nwhere a block is raised fr om position A to B\nby taking two dif ferent paths. Let the height\nAB = h. In both the situations the work done\non the object is mgh.\nFig. 10.8\nExample 10.5  Find the energy possessed\nby an object of mass 10 kg when it is at\na height of 6 m above the gr ound. Given,\ng = 9.8 m s\u20132.\nSolution:\nMass of the object, m  = 10 kg,\ndisplacement (height), h = 6 m, and\nacceleration due to gravity, g = 9.8 m s\u20132.\nFrom Eq. (10.6),\nPotential energy =  mgh\n=10 kg \u00d7 9.8 m s\u20132 \u00d7 6 m\n=588 J.\nThe potential ener gy  is 588 J.\n2024-25\n\nWORK AND E NERGY 121Example 10.6  An object of mass 12 kg is\nat a certain height above the gr ound.\nIf the  potential ener gy of the object is\n480 J, find the height at which the\nobject is with r espect to the gr ound.\nGiven, g = 10 m s\u20132.\nSolution:\nMass of the object, m = 12 kg,\npotential ener\ngy, Ep = 480 J.\n     Ep=mgh\n480 J =12 kg \u00d7  10 m s\u20132 \u00d7 h\n      h = \u20132480 J\n120 kg ms = 4 m.\nThe object is at the height of 4 m.\n10.2.5 ARE VARIOUS ENERGY  FORMS\nINTERCONVERTIBLE ?\nCan we convert ener gy fr om one for m to\nanother? W e find in natur e a number of\ninstances of conversion of ener gy from one\nform to another .\nActivity ___________ 10.13\n\u2022Sit in small groups.\n\u2022Discuss the various ways of ener gy\nconversion in natur e.\n\u2022Discuss following questions in your\ngroup:\n(a)How do gr een plants pr oduce food?\n(b)Wher e do they get their ener gy from?\n(c)Why does the air move fr om place\nto place?\n(d)How ar e fuels, such as coal and\npetroleum for med?\n(e)What kinds of ener\ngy conversions\nsustain the water cycle?\nActivity ___________ 10.14\n\u2022Many of the human activities and the\ngadgets we use involve conversion of\nenergy from one for m to another .\n\u2022Make a list of such activities and\ngadgets.\n\u2022Identify in each activity/gadget the\nkind of energy conversion that takes\nplace.10.2.6 LAW OF CONSERVATION  OF ENERGY\nIn activities 10.13 and 10.14, we learnt that\nthe form of energy can be changed from one\nform to another . What happens to the total\nenergy of a system during or after the process?\nWhenever energy gets transformed, the total\nenergy remains unchanged. This is the law of\nconservation of energy. According to this law,\nenergy can only be converted from one form\nto another; it can neither be created or\ndestroyed. The total energy before and after\nthe transformation remains the same. The law\nof conservation of energy is valid                  in\nall situations and for all kinds of\ntransformations.\nConsider a simple example. Let an object\nof mass, m be made to fall freely from a     height,\nh. At the start, the potential energy is  mgh and\nkinetic energy is zero. Why is the kinetic\nenergy zero? It is zero because its velocity is\nzero. The total energy of the object is thus mgh.\nAs it falls, its potential energy will change into\nkinetic energy. If v is the velocity of the object\nat a given instant, the kinetic energy would be\n\u00bdmv2. As the fall of the object continues, the\npotential energy would decrease while the\nkinetic energy would increase. When the object\nis about to reach the ground, h = 0 and v  will\nbe the highest. Therefore, the kinetic energy\nwould be the largest and potential energy the\nleast.  However , the sum of the potential ener gy\nand kinetic energy of the object would be the\nsame at all points. That is,\npotential energy + kinetic energy = constant\n   or\n1constant.\n22mgh + mv = (10.7)\nThe sum of kinetic energy and potential energy\nof an object is its total mechanical energy.\nWe find that during the fr ee fall of the object,\nthe decrease in potential energy, at any point\nin its path, appears as an equal amount of\nincrease in kinetic energy. (Here the effect of\nair resistance on the motion of the object has\nbeen ignored.) There is thus a continual\ntransformation of gravitational potential\nenergy into kinetic energy.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 122A stronger person may do certain work in\nrelatively less time. A more powerful vehicle\nwould complete a journey in a shorter time\nthan a less power ful one. W e talk of the power\nof machines like motorbikes and motor cars.\nThe speed with which these vehicles change\nenergy or do work is a basis for their\nclassification.  Power measur es the speed of\nwork done, that is, how fast or slow work is\ndone. Power is defined as the rate of doing\nwork or the rate of transfer of ener gy. If an\nagent does a work W   in time t, then power is\ngiven by:\nPower = work/time\norWP =\nt(10.8)\nThe unit of power is watt [in honour of\nJames W att (1736 \u2013 1819)] having the symbol\nW. 1 watt is the power of an agent, which\ndoes work at the rate of 1 joule per second.\nWe can also say that power is 1 W when the\nrate of consumption of ener gy is    1 J s\u20131.\n1 watt = 1 joule/second or 1 W = 1 J s\u20131.\nWe expr ess lar ger rates of energy transfer in\nkilowatts (kW).\n1 kilowatt =1000 watts\n1 kW =1000 W\n1 kW =1000 J s\u20131.\nThe power of an agent may vary with time.\nThis means that the agent may be doing work\nat dif ferent rates at dif ferent intervals of time.\nTherefore the concept of average power is\nuseful. W e obtain average power by dividing\nthe total energy consumed by the total time\ntaken.\nExample 10.7  Two girls, each of weight 400\nN climb up a rope through a height of 8\nm. W e name one of the girls A and the\nother B.  Girl A takes 20 s while B takes\n50 s to accomplish this task. What is the\npower expended by each girl?\nSolution:\n(i)Power expended by girl A:\nWeight of the girl, mg  = 400 N\nDisplacement (height), h = 8 mActivity ___________ 10.15\n\u2022An object of mass 20 kg is dropped\nfrom a height of 4 m.  Fill in the blanks\nin the following table by computing\nthe potential energy and kinetic\nenergy in each case.\nHeight at Potential Kinetic Ep + Ek\nwhich object energy energy\nis located (Ep= mgh) (Ek = mv2/2)\nm J J J\n4\n3\n2\n1\nJust above\nthe gr ound\n\u2022For simplifying the calculations, take\nthe value of  g as 10 m s\u20132.\nThink it over !\nWhat would have happened if natur e had\nnot allowed the transfor mation of ener gy?\nTher\ne is a view that life could not have\nbeen possible without transfor mation of\nenergy. Do you agree with this?\n10.3Rate of Doing Work\nDo all of us work at the same rate? Do\nmachines consume or transfer ener gy at the\nsame rate? Agents that transfer ener gy do\nwork at dif ferent rates. Let us understand this\nfrom the following activity:\nActivity ___________ 10.16\n\u2022Consider two children, say A and B.\nLet us say they weigh the same.  Both\nstart climbing up a r ope separately.\nBoth r each a height of 8 m.

The unit of work is joule:\n1 joule = 1 newton \u00d7  1 metre.\n\u2022 Work done on an object by a for ce would be zer o if the\ndisplacement of the object is zero.\n\u2022 An object having capability to do work is said to possess\nenergy.

Why and how?\nFrom the above thr ee activities (1.3, 1.4 and\n1.5), we can conclude the following:Fig. 1.2:  Estimating how small ar e the particles of\nmatter . With every dilution, though the colour\nbecomes light, it is still visible.\nThis experiment shows that just a few\ncrystals of potassium per manganate can\ncolour a lar ge volume of water (about\n1000 L). So we conclude that there must be\nmillions of tiny particles in just one crystal\nof potassium permanganate, which keep\non dividing themselves into smaller and\nsmaller particles.\nThe same activity can be done using 2 mL\nof Dettol instead of potassium permanganate.\nThe smell can be detected even on\nrepeated dilution.\nThe particles of matter are very small \u2013\nthey ar e small beyond our imagination!!!!\n1.2Characteristics of Particles of\nMatter\n1.2.1 PARTICLES OF MATTER  HAVE  SPACE\nBETWEEN THEM\nIn activities 1.1 and 1.2 we saw that particles\nof sugar , salt, Dettol, or potassium\npermanganate got evenly distributed in water .\nSimilarly, when we make tea, cof fee or\nlemonade ( nimbu paani ), particles of one type\nof matter get into the spaces between particles\nof the other . This shows that ther e is enough\nspace between particles of matter .\n2024-25\n\nMATTER IN OUR SURROUNDING S 3\u2022If we consider each student as a\nparticle of matter , then in which gr oup\nthe particles held each other with the\nmaximum force?\nActivity ______________ 1.7\n\u2022Take an iron nail, a piece of chalk and\na rubber band.\n\u2022Try breaking them by hammering,\ncutting or stretching.\n\u2022In which of the above three\nsubstances do you think the particles\nare held together with greater force?\nActivity ______________ 1.8\n\u2022Take some water in a container , try\ncutting the surface of water with your\nfingers.\n\u2022Were you able to cut the sur face of\nwater?\n\u2022What could be the reason behind the\nsurface of water remaining together?\nThe above three activities (1.6, 1.7 and 1.8)\nsuggest that particles of matter have force\nacting between them. This force keeps the\nparticles together . The str ength of this for ce of\nattraction varies from one kind of matter to\nanother .\nuestions\n1.Which of the following are\nmatter?\nChair , air, love, smell, hate,\nalmonds, thought, cold, lemon\nwater , smell of per fume.\n2.Give reasons for the following\nobservation:\nThe smell of hot sizzling food\nreaches you several metres\naway, but to get the smell from\ncold food you have to go close.\n3.A diver is able to cut through\nwater in a swimming pool. Which\nproperty of matter does this\nobservation show?\n4.What are the characteristics of\nthe particles of matter?Particles of matter are continuously\nmoving, that is, they possess what we call\nthe kinetic ener gy. As the temperatur e rises,\nparticles move faster . So, we can say that with\nincrease in temperatur e the kinetic ener gy of\nthe particles also incr eases.\nIn the above thr ee activities we observe\nthat particles of matter inter mix on their own\nwith each other . They do so by getting into\nthe spaces between the particles. This\nintermixing of particles of two dif ferent types\nof matter on their own is called dif fusion. W e\nalso observe that on heating, dif fusion\nbecomes faster . Why does this happen?\n1.2.3 PARTICLES  OF MATTER  ATTRACT\nEACH OTHER\nActivity ______________ 1.6\n\u2022Play this  game in the field\u2014 make four\ngroups and for m human chains as\nsuggested:\n\u2022The first group should hold each\nother from the back and lock arms\nlike Idu-Mishmi dancers (Fig. 1.3).\nFig. 1.3\n\u2022The second group should hold hands\nto for m a human chain.\n\u2022The third gr oup should for m a chain\nby touching each other with only their\nfinger tips.\n\u2022Now, the fourth gr oup of students\nshould run ar ound and try to br eak the\nthree human chains one by one  into\nas many small gr oups as possible.\n\u2022Which gr oup was the easiest to br eak?\nWhy?Q\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 41.3States of Matter\nObserve different types of matter around you.\nWhat ar e its dif ferent states? W e can see that\nmatter ar ound us exists in thr ee dif ferent\nstates\u2013 solid, liquid and gas. These states of\nmatter arise due to the variation in the\ncharacteristics of the particles of matter .\nNow, let us study about the pr operties of\nthese thr ee states of matter in detail.\n1.3.1 THE SOLID  STATE\nActivity _____________  1.9\n\u2022Collect the following articles \u2014 a pen,\na book, a needle and a piece of wooden\nstick.\n\u2022Sketch the shape of the above articles\nin your notebook by moving a pencil\naround them.\n\u2022Do all these have a definite shape,\ndistinct boundaries and a fixed volume?\n\u2022What happens if they are hammered,\npulled or dr opped?\n\u2022Are these capable of dif fusing into each\nother?\n\u2022Try compr essing them by applying\nforce. Ar e you able to compr ess them?\nAll the above ar e examples of solids. W e\ncan observe that all these have a definite\nshape, distinct boundaries and fixed volumes,\nthat is, have negligible compr essibility. Solids\nhave a tendency to maintain their shape when\nsubjected to outside for ce. Solids may br eak\nunder for ce but it is dif ficult to change their\nshape, so they ar e rigid.\nConsider the following:\n(a)What about a rubber band, can it\nchange its shape on str etching? Is it\na solid?\n(b)What about sugar and salt? When\nkept in dif ferent jars these take the\nshape of the jar . Are they solid?\n(c)What about a sponge? It is a solid\nyet we ar e able to compr ess it. Why?\nAll the above ar e solids as:\n\u2022A rubber band changes shape under\nforce and regains the same shape whenthe force is removed. If excessive force is\napplied, it breaks.\n\u2022The shape of each individual sugar or\nsalt crystal r emains fixed, whether we\ntake it in our hand, put it in a plate or in\na jar.\n\u2022A sponge has minute holes, in which\nair is trapped, when we pr ess it, the air\nis expelled out and we ar e able to\ncompr ess it.\n1.3.2 THE LIQUID  STATE\nActivity _____________ 1.10\n\u2022Collect the following:\n(a)water , cooking oil, milk, juice, a\ncold drink.\n(b)containers of dif ferent shapes. Put\na 50 mL mark on these containers\nusing a measuring cylinder fr om\nthe laboratory.\n\u2022What will happen if these liquids ar e\nspilt on the floor?\n\u2022Measur e 50 mL of any one liquid and\ntransfer it into dif ferent containers one\nby one. Does the volume r emain the\nsame?\n\u2022Does the shape of the liquid r emain the\nsame ?\n\u2022When you pour the liquid fr om one\ncontainer into another , does it flow\neasily?\nWe observe that liquids have no fixed\nshape but have a fixed volume. They take up\nthe shape of the container in which they ar e\nkept. Liquids flow and change shape, so they\nare not rigid but can be called fluid.\nRefer  to activities 1.4 and 1.5 wher e we\nsaw that solids and liquids can dif fuse into\nliquids. The gases fr om the atmospher\ne\ndiffuse and dissolve in water . These gases,\nespecially oxygen and carbon dioxide, ar e\nessential for the survival of aquatic animals\nand plants.\nAll living cr eatur es need to br eathe for\nsurvival. The aquatic animals can br eathe\nunder water due to the pr esence of dissolved\noxygen  in water . Thus, we may conclude that\nsolids, liquids and gases can diffuse into\nliquids. The rate of diffusion of liquids is\n2024-25\n\nMATTER IN OUR SURROUNDING S 5higher  than that of solids.  This is due to the\nfact that in the liquid state, particles move\nfreely and have greater space between each\nother as compared to particles in the solid\nstate.\n1.3.3 THE GASEOUS  STATE\nHave you ever observed a balloon seller filling\na lar ge number of balloons fr om a single\ncylinder of gas? Enquire fr om him how many\nballoons is he able to fill fr om one cylinder .\nAsk him which gas does he have in the cylinder .\nActivity _____________ 1.11\n\u2022Take thr ee 100 mL syringes and close\ntheir nozzles by  rubber corks, as\nshown in Fig.1.4.\n\u2022Remove the pistons fr om all the\nsyringes.\n\u2022Leaving one syringe untouched, fill\nwater in the second and pieces of chalk\nin the third.\n\u2022Insert the pistons back into the\nsyringes. Y ou may apply some vaseline\non the pistons befor e inserting them\ninto the syringes for their smooth\nmovement.\n\u2022Now, try to compr ess the content by\npushing the piston in each syringe.We have observed that gases ar e highly\ncompr essible as compared to solids and\nliquids. The liquefied petr oleum gas (LPG)\ncylinder that we get in our home for cooking\nor the oxygen supplied to hospitals in\ncylinders is compr essed gas. Compressed\nnatural gas (CNG) is used as fuel these days\nin vehicles. Due to its high compr essibility,\nlarge volumes of a gas can be compr essed\ninto a small cylinder and transported easily.\nWe  come to know of what is being cooked\nin the kitchen without even entering ther e,\nby the smell that r eaches our nostrils. How\ndoes this smell r\neach us? The particles of the\naroma of food mix with the particles of air\nspread fr om the kitchen, r each us and even\nfarther away. The smell of hot cooked food\nreaches us in seconds; compare this with the\nrate of dif fusion of solids and liquids. Due to\nhigh speed of particles and lar ge space\nbetween   them, gases show the pr operty of\ndiffusing very fast into other gases.\nIn the gaseous state, the particles move\nabout randomly at high speed. Due to this\nrandom movement, the particles hit each\nother and also the walls of the container . The\npressur e exerted by the gas is because of this\nforce exerted by gas particles per unit ar ea\non the walls of the container .\nFig. 1.4\n\u2022What do you observe? In which case\nwas the piston easily pushed in?\n\u2022What do you infer fr om your\nobservations?\nFig.1.5: a, b and c show the magnified schematic\npictur es of the thr ee states of matter . The\nmotion of the particles can be seen and\ncompar ed in the thr ee states of matter .\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 61.4.1 EFFECT  OF CHANGE  OF TEMPERATURE\nActivity _____________ 1.12\n\u2022Take about 150 g of ice in a beaker and\nsuspend a laboratory ther mometer so\nthat its bulb is in contact with the ice,\nas in Fig. 1.6.uestions\n1.The mass per unit volume of a\nsubstance is called density.\n(density = mass/volume).\nArrange the following in or der of\nincreasing density \u2013 air , exhaust\nfrom chimneys, honey, water ,\nchalk, cotton and ir on.\n2.(a)Tabulate the dif ferences in\nthe characterisitcs of states\nof matter .\n(b)Comment upon the following:\nrigidity, compr essibility,\nfluidity, filling a gas\ncontainer , shape, kinetic\nenergy and density.\n3.Give r easons\n(a)A gas fills completely the\nvessel in which it is kept.\n(b)A gas exerts pr essur e on the\nwalls of the container .\n(c)A wooden table should be\ncalled a solid.\n(d)We can easily move our hand\nin air but to do the same\nthrough a solid block of wood\nwe need a karate expert.\n4.Liquids generally have lower\ndensity as compar ed to solids.\nBut you must have observed that\nice floats on water . Find out why.\n1.4Can Matter Change its State?\nWe all know fr om our observation that water\ncan exist in thr ee states of matter\u2013\n\u2022solid, as ice,\n\u2022liquid, as the familiar water , and\n\u2022gas, as water vapour .\nWhat happens inside the matter during\nthis change of state? What happens to the\nparticles of matter during the change of\nstates? How does this change of state take\nplace? W e need answers to these questions,\nisn\u2019t it?Q\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 1.6: (a) Conversion of ice to water , (b) conversion\nof water to water vapour\n2024-25\n\nMATTER IN OUR SURROUNDING S 7\u2022Start heating the beaker on a low flame.\n\u2022Note the temperature when the ice\nstarts melting.\n\u2022Note the temperatur e when all the ice\nhas converted into water .\n\u2022Recor d your observations for this\nconversion of solid to liquid state.\n\u2022Now, put a glass r od in the beaker and\nheat while stirring till the water starts\nboiling.\n\u2022Keep a car eful eye on the ther mometer\nreading till most of the water has\nvaporised.\n\u2022Recor d your observations for the\nconversion of water in the liquid state\nto the gaseous state.\nOn increasing the temperatur e of solids,\nthe kinetic ener gy of the particles increases.\nDue to the incr ease in kinetic ener gy, the\nparticles start vibrating with gr eater speed.\nThe ener gy supplied by heat over\ncomes the\nforces of attraction between the particles. The\nparticles leave their fixed positions and start\nmoving mor e freely. A stage is reached when\nthe solid melts and is converted to a liquid.\nThe minimum temperature at which a solid\nmelts to become a liquid at the atmospheric\npressure is called its melting point.\nThe melting point of a solid is an indication\nof the strength of the force of attraction\nbetween its particles.\nThe melting point of ice is 273.15 K *. The\nprocess of melting, that is, change of solid\nstate into liquid state is also known as fusion.\nWhen a solid melts, its temperature\nremains the same, so where does the heat\nenergy go?\nYou must have observed, during the\nexperiment of melting, that the temperatur e\nof the system does not change after the\nmelting point is reached, till all the ice melts.\nThis happens even though we continue to\nheat the beaker, that is, we continue to supply\nheat. This heat gets used up in changing thestate by overcoming the forces of attraction\nbetween the particles. As this heat energy is\nabsorbed by ice without showing any rise in\ntemperatur e, it is consider ed that it gets\nhidden into the contents of the beaker and is\nknown as the latent heat. The wor d latent\nmeans hidden. The amount of heat ener gy\nthat is r equir ed to change 1 kg of a solid into\nliquid at atmospheric pr essur e at its melting\npoint is known as the latent heat of fusion.\nSo, particles in water at 0oC (273 K) have more\nenergy as compared to particles in ice at the\nsame temperature.\nWhen we supply heat ener gy to water ,\nparticles start moving even faster .  At a certain\ntemperatur e, a point is r eached when the\nparticles have enough energy to break fr ee\nfrom the forces of attraction of each other . At\nthis temperatur e the liquid starts changing\ninto gas. The temperature at which a liquid\nstarts boiling at the atmospheric pr essur e is\nknown as its boiling point. Boiling is a bulk\nphenomenon. Particles fr om the bulk of the\nliquid gain enough ener gy to change into the\nvapour state.\nFor water this temperature is 373 K\n(100oC = 273 + 100 = 373 K).\nCan you define the latent heat of\nvaporisation? Do it in the same way as we\nhave defined the latent heat of fusion.\nParticles in steam, that is, water vapour at\n373 K (1000 C) have mor e ener gy than water\nat the same temperatur e. This is because\nparticles in steam have absorbed extra ener gy\nin the for m of latent heat of vaporisation.\n*Note: Kelvin is the SI unit of temperature, 0o C =273.15 K. For convenience, we take 0o C = 273 K after\nrounding off the decimal. To change a temperature on the Kelvin scale to the Celsius scale you\nhave to subtract 273 from the given temperature, and to convert a temperature on the Celsius\nscale to the Kelvin scale you have to add 273 to the given temperature.So, we infer that the state of matter can\nbe changed into another state by changing\nthe temperature.\nWe have lear nt that substances ar ound\nus change state fr om solid to liquid and fr om\nliquid to gas on application of heat. But there\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 8enclosed in a cylinder? Will the particles come\ncloser? Do you think that increasing or\ndecreasing the pressure can change the state\nof matter?are some that change directly from solid state\nto gaseous state and vice versa without\nchanging into the liquid state.\nActivity _____________ 1.13\n\u2022Take some camphor . Crush it and put\nit in a china dish.\n\u2022Put an inverted funnel over the china\ndish.\n\u2022Put a cotton plug on the stem of the\nfunnel, as shown in Fig. 1.7.\n* atmospher e (atm) is a unit of measuring pr essur e exerted by a gas. The unit of pr essur e is Pascal (Pa):\n1 atmospher e = 1.01 \u00d7 105 Pa. The pr essur e of air in atmospher e is called atmospheric pr essur e. The\natmospheric pr essur e at sea level is 1 atmospher e, and is taken as the nor mal atmospheric pr essur e.\nFig. 1.7: Sublimation of camphorFig. 1.8: By applying pressure, particles of matter\ncan be brought close together\nApplying pressure and reducing\ntemperatur e can liquefy gases.\nHave you hear d of solid carbon dioxide\n(CO2)? It is stor ed  under high pr essur e. Solid\nCO2 gets converted directly into gaseous state\non decr ease of pr essur e to 1 atmospher e*\nwithout coming into liquid state. This is the\nreason that solid carbon dioxide is also known\nas dry ice.\nThus, we can say that pr essur e and\ntemperature deter mine the state of a\nsubstance, whether it will be solid, liquid\nor gas.\u2022Now, heat slowly and observe.\n\u2022What do you infer from the above\nactivity?\nA change of state directly from solid to gas\nwithout changing into liquid state is called\nsublimation and the direct change of gas to\nsolid without changing into liquid is called\ndeposition.\n1.4.2 EFFECT  OF CHANGE  OF\n PRESSURE\nWe have alr eady lear nt that the dif ference in\nvarious states of matter is due to the\ndifference in the distances between the\nconstituent particles.

If the sur face ar ea is\nincreased, the rate of evaporation\nincreases. For example, while putting\nclothes for drying up we spr ead them out.\n\u2022an incr ease of temperature:\nWith the incr ease of temperatur e, mor e\nnumber of particles get enough kinetic\nenergy to go into the vapour state.\n\u2022a decr ease in humidity:\nHumidity is the amount of water vapour\npresent in air . The air ar ound us cannot\nhold mor e than a definite amount of\nwater vapour at a given temperatur e. If\nthe amount of water in air is alr eady high,\nthe rate of evaporation decr eases.\n\u2022an incr ease in wind speed:\nIt is a common observation that clothes\ndry faster on a windy day. W ith the\nincr\nease in wind speed, the particles of\nwater vapour move away with the wind,\ndecreasing the amount of water vapour\nin the surr ounding.\n1.5.2 HOW DOES EVAPORATION  CAUSE\nCOOLING?\nIn an open vessel, the liquid keeps on\nevaporating. The particles of liquid absorb\nenergy from the surr ounding to regain the\nenergy lost during evaporation. This\nabsorption of energy from the surroundings\nmake the surroundings cold.uestions\n1.Convert the following temperature\nto celsius scale:\na.  300 K b.   573 K\n2.What is the physical state of\nwater at:\na.  250oC b.   100oC ?\n3.For any substance, why does the\ntemperature remain constant\nduring the change of state?\n4.Suggest a method to liquefy\natmospheric gases.\n1.5 Evaporation\nDo we always need to heat or change pressure\nfor changing the state of matter? Can you\nquote some examples from everyday life where\nchange of state from liquid to vapour takes\nplace without the liquid reaching the boiling\npoint? W ater, when left uncovered, slowly\nchanges into vapour . Wet clothes dry up. What\nhappens to water in the above two examples?\nWe know that particles of matter ar e\nalways moving and are never at rest. At a given\ntemperature in any gas, liquid or solid, there\nare particles with different amounts of kinetic\nenergy. In the case of liquids, a small fraction\nof particles at the surface, having higher\nkinetic energy, is able to break away from the\nforces of attraction of other particles and gets\nconverted into vapour . This phenomenon of\nchange of  liquid into vapours at any\ntemperature below its boiling point is called\nevaporation.\n1.5.1 FACTORS AFFECTING\nEVAPORATION\nLet us understand this with an activity.\nActivity _____________ 1.14\n\u2022Take 5 mL of water in a test tube and\nkeep it near a window or under a fan.\n\u2022Take 5 mL of water in an open china\ndish and keep it near a window or\nunder a fan.\n\u2022Take 5 mL of water in an open chinaQ\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 10What\nyou have\nlearnt\n\u2022 Matter is made up of small particles.\n\u2022 The matter around us exists in three states\u2014solid, liquid\nand gas.\n\u2022 The forces of attraction between the particles are maximum in\nsolids, inter mediate in liquids and minimum in gases.\n\u2022 The spaces in between the constituent particles and kinetic\nenergy of the particles ar e minimum in the case of solids,\nintermediate in liquids and maximum in gases.What happens when you pour some\nacetone (nail polish remover) on your palm?\nThe particles gain energy from your palm or\nsurroundings and evaporate causing the palm\nto feel cool.\nAfter a hot sunny day, people sprinkle\nwater on the r oof or open gr ound because\nthe large latent heat of vaporisation of water\nhelps to cool the hot sur face.\nCan you cite some mor e examples fr om\ndaily life wher e we can feel the ef fect of cooling\ndue to evaporation?\nWhy should we wear cotton clothes in\nsummer?\nDuring summer , we perspir e mor e\nbecause of the mechanism of our body which\nkeeps us cool. W e know that during\nevaporation, the particles at the sur face of\nthe liquid gain ener\ngy from the surr oundings\nor body sur face and change into vapour . The\nheat ener gy equal to the latent heat of\nvaporisation is absorbed fr om the body\nleaving the body cool. Cotton, being a good\nabsorber of water helps in absorbing the\nsweat and exposing it to the atmosphere for\neasy evaporation.Why do we see water droplets on the outer\nsurface of a glass containing ice-cold\nwater?\nLet us take some ice-cold water in a\ntumbler . Soon we will see water dr oplets on\nthe outer sur face of the tumbler .

Litmus is a natural indicator , turmeric is another\nsuch indicator . Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater . You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases.\nIn this Chapter , we will study the r eactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other\u2019s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life.\nDo Y ou Know?Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator . When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea , Petunia  and Geranium , which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n2024-25\n\nScience 182.1 2.12.12.12.1UNDERST\nUNDERSTUNDERST UNDERSTUNDERST ANDING THE CHEMICANDING THE CHEMICANDING THE CHEMICANDING THE CHEMICANDING THE CHEMIC AL PROPERTIES OFAL PROPERTIES OFAL PROPERTIES OFAL PROPERTIES OFAL PROPERTIES OF\nACIDS AND BASESACIDS AND BASESACIDS AND BASESACIDS AND BASESACIDS AND BASES\n2.1.1 Acids and Bases in the Laborator y\nActivity 2.1Activity 2.1Activity 2.1Activity 2.1Activity 2.1\nThese indicators tell us whether a substance is acidic or basic by\nchange in colour .

T ie up the bag tightly and leave over night in\nthe fridge. The cloth strips can now be used to test for acids and\nbases.\n/square6Take two of these cloth strips and check their odour .\n/square6Keep them on a clean surface and put a few drops of dilute HCl\nsolution on one strip and a few drops of dilute NaOH solution on\nthe other .\n2024-25\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts 19Which of these \u2013 vanilla, onion and clove, can be used as olfactory\nindicators on the basis of your observations?\nLet us do some more activities to understand the chemical properties\nof acids and bases.\n2.1.2 How do Acids and Bases React with Metals?/square6Rinse both cloth strips with water and again check their odour .\n/square6Note your observations.\n/square6Now take some dilute vanilla essence and clove oil and check their\nodour .\n/square6Take some dilute HCl solution in one test tube and dilute NaOH\nsolution in another .

The reaction taking place is written as  \u2013\nNaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) \u2192 NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\nThe reaction between an acid and a base to give a salt and water is\nknown as a neutralisation reaction. In general, a neutralisation reaction\ncan be written as \u2013\nBase + Acid \u2192 Salt + W ater\n2.1.5 Reaction of Metallic Oxides with Acids\nActivity 2.7Activity 2.7Activity 2.7Activity 2.7Activity 2.7\n/square6Take a small amount of copper oxide in a beaker and add dilute\nhydrochloric acid slowly while stirring.\n/square6Note the colour of the solution. What has happened to the copper\noxide?\nYou will notice that the colour of the solution becomes blue-gr een\nand the copper oxide dissolves. The blue-green colour of the solution is\ndue to the formation of copper(II) chloride in the reaction. The general\nreaction between a metal oxide and an acid can be written as \u2013\nMetal oxide + Acid \u2192 Salt + W aterMetal carbonate/Metal hydrogencarbonate + Acid \u2192 Salt + Carbon dioxide + W ater\n2.1.4 How do Acids and Bases React with each other?\n2024-25\n\nScience 22Now write and balance the equation for the above reaction. Since\nmetallic oxides react with acids to give salts and water , similar to the\nreaction of a base with an acid, metallic oxides are said to be basic oxides.\n2.1.6 Reaction of a Non-metallic Oxide with Base\nYou saw the r eaction between carbon dioxide and calcium hydr oxide\n(lime water) in Activity 2.5. Calcium hydroxide, which is a base, reacts\nwith carbon dioxide to pr oduce a salt and water . Since this is similar to\nthe reaction between a base and an acid, we can conclude that non-\nmetallic oxides are acidic in nature.\nQUESTIONS\n?1. Why should curd and sour substances not be kept in brass and copper\nvessels?\n2. Which gas is usually liberated when an acid reacts with a metal?\nIllustrate with an example. How will you test for the presence of\nthis gas?\n3. Metal compound A reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to produce\neffervescence. The gas evolved extinguishes a bur ning candle.

What leads to this similarity in pr operties? W e saw in Activity\n2.3 that all acids generate hydrogen gas on reacting with metals, so\nhydrogen seems to be common to all acids. Let us perform an Activity to\ninvestigate whether all compounds containing hydrogen are acidic.\nActivity 2.8Activity 2.8Activity 2.8Activity 2.8Activity 2.8\n/square6Take solutions of glucose, alcohol,\nhydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, etc.\n/square6Fix two nails on a cork, and place the cork in\na 100 mL beaker .\n/square6Connect the nails to the two terminals of a\n6 volt battery through a bulb and a switch, as\nshown in Fig. 2.3.\n/square6Now pour some dilute HCl in the beaker and\nswitch on the current.\n/square6Repeat with dilute sulphuric acid.\n/square6What do you observe?\n/square6Repeat the experiment separately with\nglucose and alcohol solutions. What do you\nobserve now?\n/square6Does the bulb glow in all cases?\nFigure 2.3Figure 2.3Figure 2.3Figure 2.3Figure 2.3\nAcid solution in water\nconducts electricity\n2024-25\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts 23The bulb will start glowing in the case of acids, as shown in Fig. 2.3.\nBut you will observe that glucose and alcohol solutions do not conduct\nelectricity. Glowing of the bulb indicates that there is a flow of electric\ncurrent through the solution. The electric current is carried through the\nacidic solution by ions.\nAcids contain H+ ion as cation and anion such as C l\u2013 in HCl, N\nO3\u2013 in\nHNO3, SO2\u2013\n4 in H2SO4, CH3COO\u2013 in CH3COOH. Since the cation present in\nacids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in\nsolution, which are responsible for their acidic properties.\nRepeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity?\n2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a W ater Solution?\nDo acids produce ions only in aqueous solution? Let us test this.\nActivity 2.9Activity 2.9Activity 2.9Activity 2.9Activity 2.9\n/square6Take about 1g solid NaCl in a clean and\ndry test tube and set up the apparatus as\nshown in Fig. 2.4.\n/square6Add some concentrated sulphuric acid to\nthe test tube.\n/square6What do you observe? Is there a gas coming\nout of the delivery tube?\n/square6Test the gas evolved successively with dry\nand wet blue litmus paper .\n/square6In which case does the litmus paper change\ncolour?\n/square6On the basis of the above Activity, what do\nyou infer about the acidic character of:\n(i)dry HCl gas\n(ii)HCl solution?Figure 2.4 Figure 2.4 Figure 2.4 Figure 2.4 Figure 2.4 Preparation of  HCl gas\nThis experiment suggests that hydrogen ions in HCl are produced\nin the pr esence of water . The separation of H+ ion fr om HCl molecules\ncannot occur in the absence of water .\nHCl + H2O \u2192 H3O+ + Cl\u2013\nHydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining\nwith water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as\nH+(aq) or hydronium ion (H3O+).\nH+ + H2O \u2192 H3O+\nWe have seen that acids give H3O+ or H+(aq) ion in water . Let us see\nwhat happens when a base is dissolved in water .\nNaOH(s)H O2\uf8e7 \u2192 \uf8e7\uf8e7 \uf8e7 Na+ (aq) + OH\u2013 (aq)Note to teachers: If the climate is very humid, you will have to pass the gas produced\nthrough a guard tube (drying tube) containing calcium chloride to dry the gas.\n2024-25\n\nScience 24KOH(s) K (aq)+OH (aq)H O2 +\uf8e7 \u2192 \uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\u2013\nMg(OH)2(s)H O2\uf8e7 \u2192 \uf8e7\uf8e7 \uf8e7 Mg2+(aq)+2OH\u2013(aq)\nBases generate hydr oxide (OH\u2013) ions in water . Bases which are soluble\nin water are called alkalis.Do Y ou\nKnow?All bases do not dissolve in water . An alkali is a base that dissolves in water . They\nare soapy to touch, bitter and corrosive. Never taste or touch them as they may\ncause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis?\nNow as we have identified that all acids generate H+(aq) and all\nbases generate OH\u2013(aq), we can view the neutralisation reaction as\nfollows  \u2013\nAcid + Base \u2192 Salt + W ater\nH  X + M  OH \u2192  MX + HOH\nH+(aq) + OH\u2013 (aq) \u2192 H2O(l)\nLet us see what is involved when water is mixed with an acid or a base.\nActivity 2.10Activity 2.10Activity 2.10Activity 2.10Activity 2.10\n/square6Take 10 mL water in a beaker .\n/square6Add a few drops of concentrated H2SO4 to it and swirl the\nbeaker slowly.\n/square6Touch the base of the beaker .\n/square6Is there a change in temperature?\n/square6Is this an exothermic or endothermic process?\n/square6Repeat the above Activity with sodium hydroxide pellets\nand record your observations.Figure 2.5Figure 2.5Figure 2.5Figure 2.5Figure 2.5\nWarning sign displayed\non containers containing\nconcentrated acids and\nbasesThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly\nexothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water . The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns.\nThe glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in Fig. 2.5) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets.\nMixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH\u2013) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.\n2024-25\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts 252.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\nWe know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. W e have also lear nt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH\u2013 ions in solutions.\nCan we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution?\nCan we judge how strong a given acid or base is?\nWe can do this by making use of a universal indicator , which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.\nA scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for \u2018 potenz \u2019 in German,\nmeaning power . On the pH scale we can measur e pH generally fr om\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. Higher\nthe hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value.\nThe pH of a neutral solution is 7. V alues less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it\nrepresents an increase in OH\u2013 ion concentration in the solution, that is,\nincrease in the strength of alkali (Fig. 2.6). Generally paper impregnated\nwith the universal indicator is used for measuring pH.QUESTIONS\n?1. Why do HCl, HNO3, etc., show acidic characters in aqueous solutions\nwhile solutions of compounds like alcohol and glucose do not show acidic\ncharacter?\n2. Why does an aqueous solution of an acid conduct electricity?\n3. Why does dry HCl gas not change the colour of the dry litmus paper?\n4. While diluting an acid, why is it recommended that the acid should be\nadded to water and not water to the acid?\n5. How is the concentration of hydronium ions (H3O+) affected when a\nsolution of an acid is diluted?\n6. How is the concentration of hydroxide ions (O H\u2013) affected when excess\nbase is dissolved in a solution of sodium hydroxide?\nFigure 2.6Figure 2.6Figure 2.6Figure 2.6Figure 2.6  Variation of pH with the change in concentration of  H+(aq) and OH\u2013(aq) ions\n2024-25\n\nScience 26Activity 2.11Activity 2.11Activity 2.11Activity 2.11Activity 2.11\n/square6Test the pH values\nof solutions given in\nTable 2.2.\n/square6Record your observations.\n/square6What is the nature of each\nsubstance on the basis of\nyour observations?\nFigure 2.7 Figure 2.7 Figure 2.7 Figure 2.7 Figure 2.7 pH of some common substances shown on a pH paper (colours are only a rough guide)\nThe strength of acids and bases depends on the number of H+ ions\nand OH\u2013 ions produced, respectively. If we take hydrochloric acid and\nacetic acid of the same concentration, say one molar , then these pr oduce\ndifferent amounts of hydrogen ions. Acids that give rise to more H+ ions\nare said to be strong acids, and acids that give less H+ ions are said to be\nweak acids. Can you now say what weak and strong bases are?\n2.3.1 Impor2.3.1 Impor2.3.1 Impor2.3.1 Impor2.3.1 Impor tance of pH in Evertance of pH in Evertance of pH in Evertance of pH in Evertance of pH in Ever yday Life yday Lifeyday Lifeyday Lifeyday Life\nAre plants and animals pH sensitive?\nOur body works within the pH range of 7.0 to 7.8. Living organisms can\nsurvive only in a narrow range of pH change. When pH of rain water is\nless than 5.6, it is called acid rain. When acid rain flows into the rivers, it\nlowers the pH of the river water . The survival of aquatic life in such rivers\nbecomes difficult.Table 2.2\n S.

To find out\nthe pH required for the healthy growth of a plant, you can collect the soil\nfrom various places and check the pH in the manner described below in\nActivity 2.12. Also, you can note down which plants are growing in the\nregion from which you have collected the soil.Acids in other planets\nThe atmosphere of venus is made up of thick white and yellowish clouds of\nsulphuric acid.

It helps in the digestion of food without harming the stomach.\nDuring indigestion the stomach produces too much acid and this causes\npain and irritation. To get rid of this pain, people use bases called\nantacids. One such remedy must have been suggested by you at the\nbeginning of this Chapter . These antacids neutralise the excess acid.\nMagnesium hydroxide (Milk of magnesia), a mild base, is often used for\nthis purpose.\npH change as the cause of tooth decay\nTooth decay starts when the pH of the mouth is lower than 5.5. Tooth\nenamel, made up of calcium hydroxyapatite (a crystalline form of calcium\nphosphate) is the hardest substance in the body. It does not dissolve in\nwater , but is corr oded when the pH in the mouth is below 5.5. Bacteria\npresent in the mouth produce acids by degradation of sugar and food\nparticles remaining in the mouth after eating. The best way to prevent\nthis is to clean the mouth after eating food. Using toothpastes, which are\ngenerally basic, for cleaning the teeth can neutralise the excess acid and\nprevent tooth decay.\nSelf defence by animals and plants through chemical warfare\nHave you ever been stung by a honey-bee? Bee-sting leaves an acid\nwhich  causes pain and irritation. Use of a mild base like baking soda\non the stung area gives relief. Stinging hair of nettle leaves inject\nmethanoic acid causing burning pain.Do Y ou\nKnow?\n2024-25\n\nScience 282.4 MORE ABOUT SAL2.4 MORE ABOUT SAL2.4 MORE ABOUT SAL2.4 MORE ABOUT SAL2.4 MORE ABOUT SAL TS TSTSTSTS\nIn the previous sections we have seen the formation of salts during\nvarious reactions.

For example, NaCl and Na2SO4 belong to the\nfamily of sodium salts.  Similarly, NaCl and KCl belong to the family\nof chloride salts.

On the other\nhand, salts of a strong acid and weak base\nare acidic with pH value less than 7 and those\nof a strong base and weak acid are basic in\nnature, with pH value more than 7.\n2.4.3 Chemicals from Common Salt\nBy now you have learnt that the salt formed\nby the combination of hydrochloric acid and\nsodium hydroxide solution is called sodium\nchloride. This is the salt that you use in food.\nYou must have observed in the above Activity\nthat it is a neutral salt.\nSeawater contains many salts dissolved\nin it. Sodium chloride is separated from these\nsalts. Deposits of solid salt are also found in\nseveral parts of the world. These large crystals\nare often brown due to impurities. This is\ncalled rock salt. Beds of rock salt were formed\nwhen seas of bygone ages dried up. Rock salt\nis mined like coal.\nYou must have hear d about Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s Dandi  March. Did\nyou know that sodium chloride was such an important symbol in our\nstruggle for freedom?Table 2.4\nSalt pH Acid used Base used\n2024-25\n\nScience 30Common salt \u2014 A raw material for chemicals\nThe common salt thus obtained is an important raw material for various\nmaterials of daily use, such as sodium hydroxide, baking soda, washing\nsoda, bleaching powder and many more. Let us see how one substance\nis used for making all these different substances.\nSodium hydroxide\nWhen electricity is passed through an aqueous solution of sodium\nchloride (called brine), it decomposes to form sodium hydroxide. The\nprocess is called the chlor -alkali pr ocess because of the pr oducts for med\u2013\nchlor for chlorine and alkali for sodium hydroxide.\n2NaCl(aq) + 2H2O(l) \u2192 2NaOH(aq) + Cl2(g) + H2(g)\nChlorine gas is given off at the anode, and hydrogen gas at the cathode.\nSodium hydroxide solution is formed near the cathode. The three\nproducts produced in this process are all useful. Figure 2.8 shows the\ndifferent uses of these products.\nBleaching powder\nYou have alr eady come to know that chlorine is pr oduced during the\nelectrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride (brine). This chlorine gas is used\nfor the manufactur e of bleaching powder . Bleaching powder is pr oduced\nby the action of chlorine on dry slaked lime [Ca(OH)2]. Bleaching powder\nis represented as CaOCl2, though the actual composition is quite\ncomplex.\nCa(OH)2 + Cl2 \u2192 CaOCl2 + H2OFigure 2.8Figure 2.8Figure 2.8Figure 2.8Figure 2.8  Important products from the chlor-alkali process\n2024-25\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts 31Bleaching powder is used \u2013\n(i)for bleaching cotton and linen in the textile industry, for bleaching\nwood pulp in paper factories and for bleaching washed clothes\nin laundry;\n(ii)as an oxidising agent in many chemical industries; and\n(iii)to make drinking water free from germs.\nBaking soda\nThe baking soda is commonly used in the kitchen for making tasty crispy\npakoras, etc. Sometimes it is added for faster cooking. The chemical\nname of the compound is sodium hydrogencarbonate (NaHCO3). It is\nproduced using sodium chloride as one of the raw materials.\nNaCl + H O + CO + NH NH Cl + NaHCO2 2 3 4 3 \u2192\n(Ammonium (Sodium\nchloride) hydrogencarbonate)\nDid you check the pH of sodium hydrogencarbonate in Activity 2.14?\nCan you correlate why it can be used to neutralise an acid? It is a mild\nnon-corrosive basic salt. The following reaction takes place when it is\nheated during cooking \u2013\n2NaHCO Na CO + H O+CO3 2 3 2 2Heat\uf8e7 \u2192 \uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\n(Sodium (Sodium\nhydrogencarbonate) carbonate)\nSodium hydrogencarbonate has got various uses in the household.\nUses of Baking soda\n(i)For making baking powder , which is a mixture of baking soda\n(sodium hydrogencarbonate) and a mild edible acid such as\ntartaric acid. When baking powder is heated or mixed in water ,\nthe following reaction takes place \u2013\nNaHCO3 + H+      \u2192     CO2 + H2O + Sodium salt of acid\n         (From any acid)\nCarbon dioxide produced during the reaction can cause bread or\ncake to rise making them soft and spongy.\n(ii)Sodium hydrogencarbonate is also an ingredient in antacids.\nBeing alkaline, it neutralises excess acid in the stomach and\nprovides relief.\n(iii)It is also used in soda-acid fire extinguishers.\nWashing soda\nAnother chemical that can be obtained from sodium chloride is\nNa2CO3.10H2O (washing soda). Y ou have seen above that sodium\ncarbonate can be obtained by heating baking soda; recrystallisation of\nsodium carbonate gives washing soda. It is also a basic salt.\nNa CO H O Na CO H O\nSodium\ncar\nbonate2 3 2 2 3 2 10 10 + \u2192 .\n(\n)\n2024-25\n\nScience 32\nWhat does 10H2O signify? Does it make Na2CO3 wet? W e will addr ess\nthis question in the next section.\nSodium carbonate and sodium hydrogencarbonate are useful\nchemicals for many industrial processes as well.\nUses of washing soda\n(i)Sodium carbonate (washing soda) is used in glass, soap and\npaper industries.\n(ii)It is used in the manufacture of sodium compounds such as borax.\n(iii)Sodium carbonate can be used as a cleaning agent for domestic\npurposes.\n(iv)It is used for r emoving per manent har dness of water .\n2.4.4 Are the Cr ystals of Salts really Dr y?\nActivity 2.15Activity 2.15Activity 2.15Activity 2.15Activity 2.15\n/square6Heat a few crystals of copper sulphate\nin a dry boiling tube.\n/square6What is the colour of the copper\nsulphate after heating?\n/square6Do you notice water droplets in the\nboiling tube?

Is the blue\ncolour of copper sulphate restored?\nFigure 2.9Figure 2.9Figure 2.9Figure 2.9Figure 2.9\nRemoving water\nof crystallisationCopper sulphate crystals which seem to be dry contain water of\ncrystallisation. When we heat the crystals, this water is removed and the\nsalt turns white.\nIf you moisten the crystals again with water , you will find that blue\ncolour of the crystals reappears.\nWater of crystallisation is the fixed number of water molecules pr esent\nin one formula unit of a salt. Five water molecules are present in one\nformula unit of copper sulphate. Chemical formula for hydrated copper\nsulphate is Cu SO4. 5H2O. Now you would be able to answer the question\nwhether the molecule of Na2CO3.10H2O is wet.\nOne other salt, which possesses water of crystallisation is gypsum.\nIt has two water molecules as water of cyrstallisation. It has the chemical\nformula CaSO4.2H2O. Let us look into the use of this salt.\nPlaster of Paris\nOn heating gypsum at 373 K, it loses water molecules and becomes\ncalcium sulphate hemihydrate  ( 4 21CaSO . H O2). This is called Plaster of\n2024-25\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts 33Paris, the substance which doctors use as plaster for supporting\nfractured bones in the right position.

Our elders tell\nus that the \u2018environment\u2019 is not what it used to be earlier; others say that\nwe should work in a healthy \u2018environment\u2019; and global summits involving\nthe developed and developing countries are regularly held to discuss\n\u2018envir onmental\u2019 issues. In this chapter , we shall be studying how various\ncomponents in the environment interact with each other and how we\nimpact the environment.\n13.1 ECO13.1 ECO13.1 ECO\n13.1 ECO13.1 ECO -SYSTEM \u2014 WHA-SYSTEM \u2014 WHA-SYSTEM \u2014 WHA-SYSTEM \u2014 WHA-SYSTEM \u2014 WHA T ARE ITS COMPONENTS?T ARE ITS COMPONENTS?T ARE ITS COMPONENTS?T ARE ITS COMPONENTS?T ARE ITS COMPONENTS?\nAll organisms such as plants, animals, microorganisms and human\nbeings as well as the physical surroundings interact with each other\nand maintain a balance in nature. All the interacting organisms in an\narea together with the non-living constituents of the environment form\nan ecosystem. Thus, an ecosystem consists of biotic components\ncomprising living organisms and abiotic components comprising\nphysical factors like temperature, rainfall, wind, soil and minerals.\nFor example, if you visit a garden you will find different plants, such\nas grasses, trees; flower bearing plants like rose, jasmine, sunflower;\nand animals like frogs, insects and birds. All these living organisms\ninteract with each other and their growth, reproduction and other\nactivities are affected by the abiotic components of ecosystem. So a garden\nis an ecosystem. Other types of ecosystems are forests, ponds and lakes.\nThese are natural ecosystems while gardens and crop-fields are human-\nmade (artificial) ecosystems.\n/square6You might have seen an aquarium. Let us try to design one.\n/square6What are the things that we need to keep in mind when we create\nan aquarium? The fish would need a free space for swimming (it\ncould be a lar ge jar), water , oxygen and food.\n/square6We can pr ovide oxygen thr ough an oxygen pump (aerator) and\nfish food which is available in the market.\n2024-25\n\nOur Environment 209/square6If we add a few aquatic plants and animals it can become a self-\nsustaining system. Can you think how this happens? An aquarium\nis an example of a human-made ecosystem.\n/square6Can we leave the aquarium as such after we set it up? Why does\nit have to be cleaned once in a while? Do we have to clean ponds\nor lakes in the same manner? Why or why not?\nWe have seen in earlier classes that or ganisms can be gr ouped as\nproducers, consumers and decomposers according to the manner in\nwhich they obtain their sustenance from the environment. Let us recall\nwhat we have learnt through the self sustaining ecosystem created by\nus above. Which organisms can make organic compounds like sugar\nand starch from inorganic substances using the radiant energy of the\nSun in the presence of chlorophyll? All green plants and certain bacteria\nwhich can produce food by photosynthesis come under this category\nand are called the producers.\nOrganisms depend on the producers either directly or indirectly for\ntheir sustenance? These organisms which consume the food produced,\neither directly from producers or indirectly by feeding on other consumers\nare the consumers. Consumers can be classed variously as herbivores,\ncarnivores, omnivores and parasites. Can you give examples for each of\nthese categories of consumers?\n/square6Imagine the situation where you do not clean the  aquarium and\nsome fish and plants have died. Have you ever thought what\nhappens when an organism dies? The microorganisms, comprising\nbacteria and fungi, break-down the dead remains and waste\nproducts of organisms. These microorganisms are the decomposers\nas they break-down the complex organic substances into simple\ninorganic substances that go into the soil and are used up once\nmore by the plants. What will happen to the garbage, and dead\nanimals and plants in their absence? Will the natural replenishment\nof the soil take place, even if decomposers are not there?\nActivity 13.2Activity 13.2Activity 13.2Activity 13.2Activity 13.2\n/square6While creating an aquarium did you take care not to put an aquatic\nanimal which would eat others?

Why or why not?\n2024-25\n\nScience 210Figure 13.2Figure 13.2Figure 13.2Figure 13.2Figure 13.2\nTrophic levels13.1.1 F ood Chains and W ebs\nIn Activity 13.4 we have formed a series of organisms feeding\non one another . This series or or ganisms taking part at\nvarious biotic levels form a food chain (Fig. 13.1).\nEach step or level of the food chain forms a trophic level.\nThe autotrophs or the producers are at the first trophic level.\nThey fix up the solar energy and make it available for\nheterotrophs or the consumers. The herbivores or the primary\nconsumers come at the second, small carnivores or the\nsecondary consumers at the third and larger carnivores or\nthe tertiary consumers form the fourth trophic level (Fig. 13.2).\nWe know that the food we eat acts as a fuel to pr\novide us\nenergy to do work. Thus the interactions among various\ncomponents of the environment involves flow of energy from\none component of the system to another . As we have studied,\nthe autotrophs capture the energy present in sunlight and\nconvert it into chemical energy. This energy supports all the\nactivities of the living world. From autotrophs, the energy goes\nto the heter otrophs and decomposers. However , as we saw in\nthe previous Chapter on \u2018Sources of Energy\u2019, when one form\nof ener gy is changed to another , some ener gy is lost to the\nenvironment in forms which cannot be used again. The flow\nof energy between various components of the environment\nhas been extensively studied and it has been found that \u2013\n/square6The green plants in a terrestrial ecosystem capture about\n1% of the energy of sunlight that falls on their leaves and convert it\ninto food energy.\n/square6When green plants are eaten by primary consumers, a great deal\nof energy is lost as heat to the environment, some amount goes\ninto digestion and in doing work and the rest goes towards growth\nand reproduction. An average of 10% of the food eaten is turned\ninto its own body and made available for the next level of\nconsumers.\n/square6Therefore, 10% can be taken as the average value for the amount\nof organic matter that is present at each step and reaches the next\nlevel of consumers.\n/square6Since so little energy is available for the next level of consumers,\nfood chains generally consist of only three or four steps. The loss\nof energy at each step is so great that very little usable energy\nremains after four trophic levels.\n/square6There are generally a greater number of individuals at the lower\ntrophic levels of an ecosystem, the greatest number is of the\nproducers.\n/square6The length and complexity of food chains vary greatly. Each organism\nis generally eaten by two or more other kinds of organisms which in\nturn are eaten by several other organisms. So instead of a straight\nline food chain, the relationship can be shown as a series of branching\nlines called a food web (Fig. 13.3).Figure 13.1Figure 13.1Figure 13.1Figure 13.1Figure 13.1\nFood chain in nature\n(a) in forest, (b) in\ngrassland and (c) in a\npond\n2024-25\n\nOur Environment 211From the energy flow diagram (Fig. 13.4),\ntwo things become clear . Firstly, the flow of\nenergy is unidirectional. The energy that is\ncaptured by the autotrophs does not revert\nback to the solar input and the energy which\npasses to the herbivores does not come back\nto autotrophs. As it moves progressively\nthrough the various trophic levels it is no\nlonger available to the previous level.\nSecondly, the energy available at each trophic\nlevel gets diminished progressively due to loss\nof energy at each level.\nAnother interesting aspect of food chain\nis how unknowingly some harmful\nchemicals enter our bodies through the food\nchain. Y ou have read in Class IX how water\ngets polluted. One of the reasons is the use of\nseveral pesticides and other chemicals to\nprotect our crops from diseases and pests.\nThese chemicals are either washed down into\nthe soil or into the water bodies. From the\nsoil, these are absorbed by the plants along\nwith water and minerals, and from the water\nbodies these are taken up by aquatic plants\nFigure 13.4  Figure 13.4  Figure 13.4  Figure 13.4  Figure 13.4  Diagram showing flow of energy in an ecosystemFigure 13.3Figure 13.3Figure 13.3Figure 13.3Figure 13.3\nFood web, consisting of\nmany food chains\n2024-25\n\nScience 212Activity 13.3Activity 13.3Activity 13.3Activity 13.3Activity 13.3and animals. This is one of the ways in which they enter the food chain.\nAs these chemicals are not degradable, these get accumulated\nprogressively at each trophic level. As human beings occupy the top\nlevel in any food chain, the maximum concentration of these chemicals\nget accumulated in our bodies. This phenomenon is known as biological\nmagnification. This is the reason why our food grains such as wheat\nand rice, vegetables and fruits, and even meat, contain varying amounts\nof pesticide residues. They cannot always be removed by washing or\nother means.\nQUESTIONS\n?1. What are trophic levels? Give an example of a food chain and state the\ndifferent trophic levels in it.\n2. What is the role of decomposers in the ecosystem?\n13.213.213.2\n13.213.2 HOW DO OUR ACTIVITIES AFFECT THEHOW DO OUR ACTIVITIES AFFECT THEHOW DO OUR ACTIVITIES AFFECT THEHOW DO OUR ACTIVITIES AFFECT THEHOW DO OUR ACTIVITIES AFFECT THE\nENVIRONMENT?ENVIRONMENT?ENVIRONMENT?ENVIRONMENT?ENVIRONMENT?\nWe are an integral part of the envir onment.

In\nthis chapter , we shall be looking at two of the environmental pr oblems\nin detail, that is, depletion of the ozone layer and waste disposal.\n13.2.1 Ozone Layer and How it is Getting Depleted\nOzone (O3) is a molecule formed by three atoms of oxygen. While O2,\nwhich we normally refer to as oxygen, is essential for all aerobic forms of\nlife. Ozone, is a deadly poison. However , at the higher levels of the\natmosphere, ozone performs an essential function. It shields the surface\nof the earth from ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. This radiation/square6Newspaper reports about pesticide levels in ready-made food items\nare often seen these days and some states have banned these\nproducts. Debate in groups the need for such bans.\n/square6What do you think would be the source of pesticides in these food\nitems? Could pesticides get into our bodies from this source through\nother food products too?\n/square6Discuss what methods could be applied to reduce our intake of\npesticides.\n2024-25\n\nOur Environment 213Activity 13.5Activity 13.5Activity 13.5Activity 13.5Activity 13.5Activity 13.4Activity 13.4Activity 13.4Activity 13.4Activity 13.4is highly damaging to organisms, for example, it is known to cause skin\ncancer in human beings.\nOzone at the higher levels of the atmosphere is a product of UV\nradiation acting on oxygen (O2) molecule. The higher energy UV\nradiations split apart some moleculer oxygen (O2) into free oxygen (O)\natoms. These atoms then combine with the molecular oxygen to form\nozone as shown\u2014\nO O+O2UV\uf8e7 \u2192\uf8e7\uf8e7\nO O O2 3\nOzone )+ \u2192\n(\nThe amount of ozone in the atmosphere began to drop sharply in\nthe 1980s. This decrease has been linked to synthetic chemicals like\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are used as refrigerants and in fire\nextinguishers. In 1987, the United Nations Environment Programme\n(UNEP) succeeded in forging an agreement to freeze CFC production at\n1986 levels. It is now mandatory for all the manufacturing companies\nto make CFC-free refrigerators throughout the world.\n/square6Collect waste material from your homes. This could include all\nthe waste generated during a day, like kitchen waste (spoilt food,\nvegetable peels, used tea leaves, milk packets and empty cartons),\nwaste paper , empty medicine bottles/strips/bubble packs, old and\ntorn clothes and br oken footwear .\n/square6Bury this material in a pit in the school garden or if there is no\nspace available, you can collect the material in an old bucket/\nflower pot and cover with at least 15 cm of soil.\n/square6Keep this material moist and observe at 15-day intervals.\n/square6What are the materials that remain unchanged over long periods\nof time?\n/square6What are the materials which change their form and structure\nover time?\n/square6Of these materials that are changed, which ones change the fastest?/square6Find out from the library, internet or newspaper reports, which\nchemicals ar e responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer .\n/square6Find out if the regulations put in place to control the emission of\nthese chemicals have succeeded in reducing the damage to the\nozone layer .

What are some of these waste materials? What happens after we\nthrow them away? Let us perform an activity to find answers to these\nquestions.\n2024-25\n\nScience 214We have seen in the chapter on \u2018Life Pr ocesses\u2019 that the food we eat is\ndigested by various enzymes in our body. Have you ever wondered why\nthe same enzyme does not break-down everything we eat? Enzymes are\nspecific in their action, specific enzymes are needed for the break-down\nof a particular substance. That is why we will not get any energy if we\ntry to eat coal! Because of this, many human-made materials like plastics\nwill not be broken down by the action of bacteria or other saprophytes.\nThese materials will be acted upon by physical processes like heat and\npressure, but under the ambient conditions found in our environment,\nthese persist for a long time.\nSubstances that are broken down by biological processes are said\nto be biodegradable. How many of the substances you buried were\nbiodegradable? Substances that are not broken down in this manner\nare said to be non-biodegradable. These substances may be inert and\nsimply persist in the environment for a long time or may harm the various\nmembers of the eco-system.\nActivity 13.6Activity 13.6Activity 13.6Activity 13.6Activity 13.6\n/square6Use the library or internet to find out more about biodegradable\nand non-biodegradable substances.\n/square6How long are various non-biodegradable substances expected to\nlast in our environment?\n/square6These days, new types of plastics which are said to be biodegradable\nare available.

In the earlier classes we have\ntalked about this problem of dealing with the garbage that we generate. Let\nus now look at the problem a bit more deeply.\n2024-25\n\nOur Environment 215Activity 13.7Activity 13.7Activity 13.7Activity 13.7Activity 13.7\n/square6Find out what happens to the waste generated at home.

The intr oduction of\ndisposable cups was hailed as a step forward for reasons of hygiene. No one at that time\nperhaps thought about the impact caused by the disposal of millions of these cups on a\ndaily basis. Some time back, \nkulhads , that is, disposable cups made of clay, were\nsuggested as an alternative. But a little thought showed that making these kulhads  on\na large scale would result in the loss of the fertile top-soil. Now disposable paper -cups\nare being used. What do you think are the advantages of disposable paper -cups over\ndisposable plastic cups?Think it over\n2024-25\n\nScience 216Activity 13.9Activity 13.9Activity 13.9Activity 13.9Activity 13.9\n/square6Search the internet or library to find out what hazardous materials\nhave to be dealt with while disposing of electronic items.

            "text": "Metals and Non-metals3 CHAPTER\nIn Class IX you have lear nt about various elements. Y ou have seen\nthat elements can be classified as metals or non-metals on the basis of\ntheir properties.\n/square6Think of some uses of metals and non-metals in your daily life.\n/square6What properties did you think of while categorising elements\nas metals or non-metals?\n/square6How are these properties related to the uses of these elements?\nLet us look at some of these properties in detail.\n3.1 PHYSIC3.1 PHYSIC3.1 PHYSIC3.1 PHYSIC3.1 PHYSIC AL PROPERTIESAL PROPERTIESAL PROPERTIESAL PROPERTIESAL PROPERTIES\n3.1.1 Metals\nThe easiest way to start grouping substances is by comparing their\nphysical properties. Let us study this with the help of the following\nactivities. For performing A ctivities 3.1 to 3.6, collect the samples of\nfollowing metals \u2013  iron, copper , aluminium, magnesium, sodium, lead,\nzinc and any other metal that is easily available.\nActivity 3.1Activity 3.1Activity 3.1Activity 3.1Activity 3.1\n/square6Take samples of  ir on, copper , aluminium and magnesium. Note\nthe appearance of each sample.\n/square6Clean the surface of each sample by rubbing them with sand paper\nand note their appearance again.\nMetals, in their pure state, have a shining surface. This property is\ncalled metallic lustre.\nActivity 3.2Activity 3.2Activity 3.2Activity 3.2Activity 3.2\n/square6Take small pieces of ir on, copper , aluminium, and magnesium.\nTry to cut these metals with a sharp knife and note your\nobservations.\n/square6Hold a piece of sodium metal with a pair of tongs.\nCAUTION:  Always handle sodium metal with care. Dry it by\npressing between the folds of a filter paper .\n/square6Put it on a watch-glass and try to cut it with a knife.\n/square6What do you observe?\n2024-25\n\nScience 38You will find that some metals can be beaten into thin sheets. This\nproperty is called malleability. Did you know that gold and silver are the\nmost malleable metals?Activity 3.3Activity 3.3Activity 3.3Activity 3.3Activity 3.3\n/square6Take pieces of ir on, zinc, lead and copper .\n/square6Place any one metal on a block of iron and strike it four or five\ntimes with a hammer . What do you observe?\n/square6Repeat with other metals.\n/square6Record the change in the shape of these metals.You will find that metals ar e generally har d. The har\ndness varies\nfrom metal to metal.\nActivity 3.4Activity 3.4Activity 3.4Activity 3.4Activity 3.4\n/square6List the metals whose wires you have seen in daily life.\nThe ability of metals to be drawn into thin wires is called ductility.\nGold is the most ductile metal. Y ou will be surprised to know that a wir e\nof about 2 km length can be drawn from one gram of gold.\nIt is because of their malleability and ductility that metals can be\ngiven different shapes according to our needs.\nCan you name some metals that are used for making cooking vessels?\nDo you know why these metals are used for making vessels? Let us do\nthe following Activity to find out the answer .\nActivity 3.5Activity 3.5Activity 3.5Activity 3.5Activity 3.5\n/square6Take an aluminium or copper\nwire. Clamp this wire on a\nstand, as shown in Fig. 3.1.\n/square6Fix a pin to the free end of the\nwire using wax.\n/square6Heat the wire with a spirit lamp,\ncandle or a burner near the\nplace where it is clamped.\n/square6What do you observe after some\ntime?\n/square6Note your observations. Does\nthe metal wire melt?\nThe above activity shows that metals are good conductors of heat\nand have high melting points. The best conductors of heat are silver and\ncopper . Lead and mer cury are comparatively poor conductors of heat.\nDo metals also conduct electricity? Let us find out.Figure 3.1Figure 3.1Figure 3.1Figure 3.1Figure 3.1\nMetals are good\nconductors of heat.\n2024-25\n\nMetals and Non-metals 39You must have seen that the wir es that carry curr ent\nin your homes have a coating of polyvinylchloride (PVC)\nor a rubber -like material. Why ar e electric wir es coated\nwith such substances?\nWhat happens when metals strike a hard surface? Do they produce\na sound? The metals that produce a sound on striking a hard surface\nare said to be sonorous. Can you now say why school bells are made of\nmetals?\n3.1.2 Non-metals\nIn the previous Class you have learnt that there are very few non-metals\nas compared to metals. Some of the examples of non-metals are carbon,\nsulphur , iodine, oxygen, hydr ogen, etc. The non-metals ar e either  solids\nor gases except bromine which is a liquid.\nDo non-metals also have physical properties similar to that of metals?\nLet us find out.Activity 3.6Activity 3.6Activity 3.6Activity 3.6Activity 3.6\n/square6Set up an electric circuit as shown in Fig. 3.2.\n/square6Place the metal to be tested in the circuit\nbetween terminals A and B as shown.\n/square6Does the bulb glow? What does this indicate?\nFigure 3.2Figure 3.2Figure 3.2Figure 3.2Figure 3.2\nMetals are good\nconductors of electricity.\nActivity 3.7Activity 3.7Activity 3.7Activity 3.7Activity 3.7\n/square6Collect samples of carbon (coal or graphite), sulphur and iodine.\n/square6Carry out the Activities 3.1 to 3.4 and 3.6 with these non-metals\nand record your observations.\nCompile your observations regarding metals and non-metals in Table 3.1.\nTable 3.1\nElement Symbol Type of Hardness Malleability Ductility Conducts Sonority\nsurface Electricity\nOn the bases of the observations recorded in Table 3.1, discuss the\ngeneral physical properties of metals and non-metals in the class. Y ou\nmust have concluded that we cannot group elements according to their\nphysical properties alone, as there are many exceptions. For example \u2013\n(i)All metals except mercury exist as solids at room temperature.\nIn Activity 3.5, you have observed that metals have high melting\n2024-25\n\nScience 40points but gallium and caesium have very low melting points.\nThese two metals will melt if you keep them on your palm.\n(ii)Iodine is a non-metal but it is lustrous.\n(iii)Carbon is a non-metal that can exist in different forms. Each\nform is called an allotrope. Diamond, an allotrope of carbon, is\nthe hardest natural substance known and has a very high melting\nand boiling point. Graphite, another allotrope of carbon, is a\nconductor of electricity.\n(iv)Alkali metals (lithium, sodium, potassium) are so soft that they\ncan be cut with a knife. They have low densities and low melting\npoints.\nElements can be more clearly classified as metals and non-metals\non the basis of their chemical properties.\nActivity 3.8Activity 3.8Activity 3.8Activity 3.8Activity 3.8\n/square6Take a magnesium ribbon and some sulphur powder .\n/square6Burn the magnesium ribbon. Collect the ashes formed and dissolve\nthem in water .\n/square6Test the r esultant solution with both r ed and blue litmus paper .\n/square6Is the product formed on burning magnesium acidic or basic?\n/square6Now bur n sulphur powder . Place a test tube over the bur ning\nsulphur to collect the fumes produced.\n/square6Add some water to the above test tube and shake.\n/square6Test this solution with blue and r ed litmus paper .\n/square6Is the product formed on burning sulphur acidic or basic?\n/square6Can you write equations for these reactions?\nQUESTIONS\n?1. Give an example of a metal which\n(i)is a liquid at room temperature.\n(ii)can be easily cut with a knife.\n(iii)is the best conductor of heat.\n(iv)is a poor conductor of heat.\n2.Explain the meanings of malleable and ductile.\n3.2 CHEMIC3.2 CHEMIC3.2 CHEMIC3.2 CHEMIC3.2 CHEMIC AL PROPERTIES OF METAL PROPERTIES OF METAL PROPERTIES OF METAL PROPERTIES OF METAL PROPERTIES OF MET ALS ALSALSALSALS\nWe will lear n about the chemical pr operties of metals in the following\nSections 3.2.1 to 3.2.4. For this, collect the samples of following metals \u2013\naluminium, copper , iron, lead, magnesium, zinc and sodium. Most non-metals pr oduce acidic oxides when dissolve in water . On\nthe other hand, most metals, give rise to basic oxides. Y ou will be lear ning\nmore about these metal oxides in the next section.\n2024-25\n\nMetals and Non-metals 413.2.1 What happens when Metals are bur nt in Air?\nYou have seen in Activity 3.8 that magnesium bur ns in air with a dazzling\nwhite flame. Do all metals react in the same manner? Let us check by\nperforming the following Activity.\nActivity 3.9Activity 3.9Activity 3.9Activity 3.9Activity 3.9\nCAUTION : The following activity needs the teacher\u2019s assistance.\nIt would be better if students wear eye protection.\n/square6Hold any of the samples taken above with a pair of tongs and try\nburning over a flame. Repeat with the other metal samples.\n/square6Collect the product if formed.\n/square6Let the products and the metal surface cool down.\n/square6Which metals burn easily?\n/square6What flame colour did you observe when the metal burnt?\n/square6How does the metal surface appear after burning?\n/square6Arrange the metals in the decreasing order of their reactivity\ntowards oxygen.\n/square6Are the products soluble in water?\nAlmost all metals combine with oxygen to form metal oxides.\nMetal  +  Oxygen \u2192 Metal oxide\n For example, when copper is heated in air , it combines with oxygen\nto form copper(II) oxide, a black oxide.\n2Cu  +  O2  \u2192  2CuO\n(Copper)      (Copper(II) oxide)\nSimilarly, aluminium forms aluminium oxide.\n4Al +3O2 \u2192 2Al2O3\n(Aluminium) (Aluminium oxide)\nRecall from Chapter 2, how copper oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid.\nWe have lear nt that metal oxides ar e basic in natur e. But some metal\noxides, such as aluminium oxide, zinc oxide show both acidic as well as\nbasic behaviour . Such metal oxides which r eact with both acids as well as\nbases to produce salts and water are known as amphoteric oxides.\nAluminium oxide reacts in the following manner with acids and bases \u2013\nAl2O3 + 6HCl \u21922AlCl3+3H2O\nAl2O3 + 2NaOH \u21922NaAlO2+H2O\n(Sodium\naluminate)\n Most metal oxides are insoluble in water but some of these dissolve\nin water to form alkalis. Sodium oxide and potassium oxide dissolve in\nwater to produce alkalis as follows \u2013\nNa2O(s) +H2O(l) \u2192 2NaOH(aq)\nK2O(s) +H2O(l) \u2192 2KOH(aq)\n2024-25\n\nScience 42We have observed in Activity 3.9 that all metals do not r eact with\noxygen at the same rate. Different metals show different reactivities\ntowards oxygen. Metals such as potassium and sodium react so\nvigorously that they catch fire if kept in the open. Hence, to protect them\nand to prevent accidental fires, they are kept immersed in kerosene oil.\nAt ordinary temperature, the surfaces of metals such as magnesium,\naluminium, zinc, lead, etc., are covered with a thin layer of oxide. The\nprotective oxide layer prevents the metal from further oxidation. Iron\ndoes not burn on heating but iron filings burn vigorously when sprinkled\nin the flame of the bur ner. Copper does not bur n, but the hot metal is\ncoated with a black coloured layer of copper(II) oxide. Silver and gold do\nnot react with oxygen even at high temperatures.Do Y ou Know?Anodising is a process of forming a thick oxide layer of aluminium. Aluminium\ndevelops a thin oxide layer when exposed to air . This aluminium oxide coat makes it\nresistant to further corrosion.  The resistance can be improved further by making the\noxide layer thicker .  During anodising, a clean aluminium article is made the anode\nand is electrolysed with dilute sulphuric acid. The oxygen gas evolved at the anode\nreacts with aluminium to make a thicker pr otective oxide layer .  This oxide layer can\nbe dyed easily to give aluminium articles an attractive finish.\nAfter performing Activity 3.9, you must have observed that sodium\nis the most reactive of the samples of metals taken here. The reaction of\nmagnesium is less vigorous implying that it is not as reactive as sodium.\nBut burning in oxygen does not help us to decide about the reactivity of\nzinc, iron, copper or lead. Let us see some more reactions to arrive at a\nconclusion about the order of reactivity of these metals.\n3.2.2 What happens when Metals react with W ater?\nActivity 3.10Activity 3.10Activity 3.10Activity 3.10Activity 3.10\nCAUTION:  This Activity needs the teacher\u2019s assistance.\n/square6Collect the samples of the same metals as in Activity 3.9.\n/square6Put small pieces of the samples separately in beakers half-filled\nwith cold water .\n/square6Which metals reacted with cold water? Arrange them in the\nincreasing or der of their r eactivity with cold water .\n/square6Did any metal produce fire on water?\n/square6Does any metal start floating after some time?\n/square6Put the metals that did not react with cold water in beakers\nhalf-filled with hot water .\n/square6For the metals that did not r eact with hot water , arrange the\napparatus as shown in Fig.  3.3 and observe their reaction with steam.\n/square6Which metals did not react even with steam?\n/square6Arrange the metals in the decr easing or der of r eactivity with water .\n2024-25\n\nMetals and Non-metals 43Metals react with water and produce a metal oxide and hydrogen\ngas. Metal oxides that are soluble in water dissolve in it to further form\nmetal hydr oxide. But all metals do not r eact with water .\nMetal +Water \u2192Metal oxide + Hydrogen\nMetal oxide +Water \u2192Metal hydroxide\nMetals like potassium and sodium r eact violently with cold water . In\ncase of sodium and potassium, the reaction is so violent and exothermic\nthat the evolved hydrogen immediately catches fire.\n2K(s)   + 2H2O(l) \u2192  2KOH(aq)  +  H2(g) + heat energy\n2Na(s) + 2H2O(l) \u2192 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g) + heat energy\nThe reaction of calcium with water is less violent. The heat evolved is\nnot sufficient for the hydrogen to catch fire.\nCa(s) + 2H2O(l) \u2192 Ca(OH)2(aq) + H2(g)\nCalcium starts floating because the bubbles of hydrogen gas formed\nstick to the surface of the metal.\nMagnesium does not r eact with cold water . It reacts with hot water\nto form magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen. It also starts floating due\nto the bubbles of hydrogen gas sticking to its surface.\nMetals like aluminium, iron and zinc do not react either with cold or\nhot water . But they r eact with steam to for m the metal oxide and hydr ogen.\n2Al(s) +3H2O(g) \u2192 Al2O3(s) + 3H2(g)\n3Fe(s) +4H2O(g) \u2192 Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)\nMetals such as  lead, copper , silver and gold do not r eact with water at all.\n3.2.3 What happens when Metals react with Acids?\nYou have alr\neady lear nt that metals r eact with acids to give a salt and\nhydrogen gas.Figure 3.3Figure 3.3Figure 3.3Figure 3.3Figure 3.3  Action of steam on a metal\n2024-25\n\nScience 44Metal + Dilute acid \u2192  Salt + Hydrogen\nBut do all metals react in the same manner? Let us find out.\nActivity 3.11Activity 3.11Activity 3.11Activity 3.11Activity 3.11\n/square6Collect all the metal samples except sodium and potassium again.\nIf the samples ar e tar nished, rub them clean with sand paper .\nCAUTION:  Do not take sodium and potassium as they react\nvigorously even with cold water .\n/square6Put the samples separately in test tubes containing dilute\nhydrochloric acid.\n/square6Suspend thermometers in the test tubes, so that their bulbs are\ndipped in the acid.\n/square6Observe the rate of formation of bubbles carefully.\n/square6Which metals reacted vigorously with dilute hydrochloric acid?\n/square6With which metal did you record the highest temperature?\n/square6Arrange the metals in the decreasing order of reactivity with dilute\nacids.\nWrite equations for the r eactions of magnesium, aluminium, zinc\nand iron with dilute hydrochloric acid.\nHydrogen gas is not evolved when a metal reacts with nitric acid. It is\nbecause HNO3 is a strong oxidising agent. It oxidises the H2 produced to\nwater and itself gets reduced to any of the nitrogen oxides (N2O, NO,\nNO2). But magnesium (Mg) and manganese (Mn) react with very dilute\nHNO3 to evolve H2 gas.\nYou must have observed in Activity 3.11, that the rate of for mation\nof bubbles was the fastest in the case of magnesium. The reaction was\nalso the most exothermic in this case. The reactivity decreases in the\norder Mg > Al > Zn > Fe. In the case of copper , no bubbles wer e seen and\nthe temperature also remained unchanged. This shows that copper does\nnot react with dilute HCl.Do Y ou Know?Aqua regia,  (Latin for \u2018royal water\u2019) is a freshly prepared mixture of concentrated\nhydrochloric acid and concentrated nitric acid in the ratio of 3:1. It can dissolve\ngold, even though neither of these acids can do so alone. Aqua regia  is a highly\ncorrosive, fuming liquid. It is one of the few reagents that is able to dissolve gold and\nplatinum.\n3.2.4 How do Metals react with Solutions of other Metal\nSalts?\nActivity 3.12Activity 3.12Activity 3.12Activity 3.12Activity 3.12\n/square6Take a clean wire of copper and an iron nail.\n/square6Put the copper wire in a solution of iron sulphate and the iron\nnail in a solution of copper sulphate taken in test tubes (Fig. 3.4).\n/square6Record your observations after 20 minutes.\n2024-25\n\nMetals and Non-metals 45/square6In which test tube did you find that a reaction has occurred?\n/square6On what basis can you say that a reaction has actually taken\nplace?\n/square6Can you correlate your observations for the Activities 3.9, 3.10\nand 3.11?\n/square6Write a balanced chemical equation for the r eaction that has taken\nplace.\n/square6Name the type of reaction.\nReactive metals can displace less\nreactive metals from their compounds in\nsolution or molten form.\nWe have seen in the pr evious sections\nthat all metals ar e not equally r eactive. W e\nchecked the reactivity of various metals\nwith oxygen, water and acids. But all\nmetals do not react with these reagents.\nSo we were not able to put all the metal\nsamples we had collected in decreasing\norder of their reactivity. Displacement\nreactions studied in Chapter 1 give better\nevidence about the reactivity of metals. It\nis simple and easy if metal A displaces\nmetal B from its solution, it is more reactive than B.\nMetal A + Salt solution of B \u2192  Salt solution of A + Metal B\nWhich metal, copper or iron, is more reactive according to your\nobservations in Activity 3.12?\n3.2.5 The Reactivity Series\nThe reactivity series is a list of metals arranged in the order of their\ndecreasing activities. After performing displacement experiments\n(Activities 1.9 and 3.12), the following series, (Table 3.2) known as the\nreactivity or activity series has been developed.\nTable 3.2 Activity series : Relative reactivities of metals\nK Potassium Most reactive\nNa Sodium\nCa Calcium\nMg Magnesium\nAl Aluminium\nZn Zinc Reactivity decreases\nFe Iron\nPb Lead\n[H] [Hydrogen]\nCu Copper\nHg Mercury\nAg Silver\nAu Gold Least reactiveFigure 3.4Figure 3.4Figure 3.4Figure 3.4Figure 3.4\nReaction of metals with\nsalt solutions\n2024-25\n\nScience 46?QUESTIONS\n1. Why is sodium kept immersed in kerosene oil?\n2. Write equations for the r eactions of\n(i)iron with steam\n(ii)calcium and potassium with water\n3. Samples of four metals A, B, C and D were taken and added to the\nfollowing solution one by one. The results obtained have been tabulated\nas follows.\n3.3 HOW DO MET3.3 HOW DO MET3.3 HOW DO MET3.3 HOW DO MET3.3 HOW DO MET ALS AND NON-METALS AND NON-METALS AND NON-METALS AND NON-METALS AND NON-MET ALS REA ALS REAALS REAALS REAALS REA CT? CT?CT? CT?CT?\nIn the above activities, you saw the reactions of metals with a number of\nreagents. Why do metals react in this manner? Let us recall what we\nlearnt about the electronic configuration of elements in Class IX. W e\nlearnt that noble gases, which have a completely filled valence shell, show\nlittle chemical activity. W e, ther efore, explain the r eactivity of elements\nas a tendency to attain a completely filled valence shell.\nLet us have a look at the electronic configuration of noble gases and\nsome metals and non-metals.\nWe can see fr om Table 3.3 that a sodium atom has one electr on in its\noutermost shell. If it loses the electron from its M shell then its L shell\nnow becomes the outermost shell and that has a stable octet. The nucleus\nof this atom still has 11 protons but the number of electrons has\nbecome 10, so there is a net positive charge giving us a sodium cation\nNa+. On the other hand chlorine has seven electrons in its outermost shellUse the Table above to answer the following questions about metals\nA, B, C and D.\n(i)Which is the most reactive metal?\n(ii) What would you observe if B is added to a solution of Copper(II)\nsulphate?\n(iii) Arrange the metals A, B, C and D in the order of decreasing\nreactivity.\n4.

If sodium and chlorine\nwere to react, the electron lost by sodium could be taken up by chlorine.\nAfter gaining an electron, the chlorine atom gets a unit negative charge,\nbecause its nucleus has 17 protons and there are 18 electrons in its K, L\nand M shells.  This gives us a chloride anion C1\u2013.

These compounds are generally brittle and\nbreak into pieces when pressure is applied.\n(ii)Melting and Boiling points : Ionic compounds have high melting\nand boiling points (see Table 3.4). This is because a considerable\namount of ener gy is r equir ed to br eak the str ong inter -ionic\nattraction.\n(iii) Solubility : Electrovalent compounds are generally soluble in\nwater and insoluble in solvents such as kerosene, petrol, etc.\n(iv)Conduction of Electricity : The conduction of electricity through\na solution involves the movement of charged particles. A solution\nof an ionic compound in water contains ions, which move to the\nopposite electrodes when electricity is passed through the\nsolution. Ionic compounds in the solid state do not conduct\nelectricity because movement of ions in the solid is not possible\ndue to their rigid structure. But ionic compounds conduct\nelectricity in the molten state. This is possible in the molten state\nsince the elecrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely\ncharged ions are overcome due to the heat. Thus, the ions move\nfreely and conduct electricity.\nQUESTIONS\n?1.

Why do ionic compounds have high melting points?\n3.4 3.43.43.43.4OCCURRENCE OF METOCCURRENCE OF METOCCURRENCE OF METOCCURRENCE OF METOCCURRENCE OF MET ALS\nALSALS ALSALS\nThe earth\u2019s crust is the major source of metals. Seawater also contains\nsome soluble salts such as sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, etc.\nThe elements or compounds, which occur naturally in the earth\u2019s crust,\nare known as minerals. At some places, minerals contain a very high\npercentage of a particular metal and the metal can be profitably extracted\nfrom it. These minerals are called ores.\n3.4.1 Extraction of Metals\nYou have lear nt about the r eactivity series of metals. Having this\nknowledge, you can easily understand how a metal is extracted from its\nore. Some metals are found in the earth\u2019s crust in the free state. Some\nare found in the form of their compounds. The metals at the bottom of\nthe activity series are the least reactive. They are often found in a free\n2024-25\n\nScience 50state. For example, gold, silver , platinum and copper ar e found in the\nfree state. Copper and silver are also found in the combined state as\ntheir sulphide or oxide ores. The metals at the top of the activity series\n(K, Na, Ca, Mg and Al) are so reactive that they are never found in\nnature as free elements. The metals in the middle of the activity series\n(Zn, Fe, Pb, etc.) are moderately reactive. They are found in the earth\u2019s\ncrust mainly as oxides, sulphides or carbonates. Y ou will find that\nthe ores of many metals are oxides. This is because oxygen is a very\nreactive element and is very abundant on the earth.\nThus on th e basis of reactivity, we can group the metals into the\nfollowing three categories (Fig. 3.9) \u2013 (i) Metals of low reactivity; (ii) Metals\nof medium reactivity; (iii) Metals of high reactivity. Different techniques\nare to be used for obtaining the metals falling in each category.K\nNa\nCa\nMg\nAl\nZn\nFe\nPb\nCu\nAg\nAuReduction using\ncarbon\nFound in native\nstateElectrolysis\nFigure 3.9Figure 3.9Figure 3.9Figure 3.9Figure 3.9\nActivity series and\nrelated metallurgy\nFigure 3.10Figure 3.10Figure 3.10Figure 3.10Figure 3.10  Steps involved in the extraction of metals from ores\n3.4.2 Enrichment of Ores\nOres mined from the earth are usually contaminated with large amounts\nof impurities such as soil, sand, etc., called gangue. The impurities must\nbe removed from the ore prior to the extraction of the metal. The processesSeveral steps are involved in the extraction of pure metal from\nores. A summary of these steps is given in Fig.3.10. Each step is\nexplained in detail in the following sections.\n2024-25\n\nMetals and Non-metals 51used for removing the gangue from the ore are based on the differences\nbetween the physical or chemical properties of the gangue and the ore.\nDifferent separation techniques are  accordingly employed.\n3.4.3 Extracting Metals Low in the Activity Series\nMetals low in the activity series are very unreactive. The oxides of these\nmetals can be  reduced to metals by heating alone. For example, cinnabar\n(HgS) is an ore of mer cury. When it is heated in air , it is first converted\ninto mercuric oxide (HgO). Mercuric oxide is then reduced to mercury\non further heating.\n2HgS(s) + 3O (g) 2HgO(s) + 2SO (g)2 2Heat\uf8e7 \u2192 \uf8e7\uf8e7 \uf8e7\n2HgO(s) 2Hg(l) + O (g)2Heat\uf8e7 \u2192 \uf8e7\uf8e7 \uf8e7\nSimilarly, copper which is found as Cu2S in nature can be obtained\nfrom its or e by just heating in air .\n2Cu S + 3O (g) 2Cu O(s) + 2SO (g)\n2Cu O + Cu S 2 2 2 2\n2 2Heat\nHeat\uf8e7 \u2192 \uf8e7\uf8e7 \uf8e7\n\uf8e7 \u2192 \uf8e7 \uf8e7\uf8e7 \uf8e7 6Cu(s) + SO (g)2\n3.4.4 Extracting Metals in the Middle of the Activity Series\nThe metals in the middle of the activity series such as iron, zinc, lead,\ncopper , are moderately r eactive. These ar e usually pr esent as sulphides\nor carbonates in nature. It is easier to obtain a metal from its oxide, as\ncompared to its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior to reduction,\nthe metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal\noxides. The sulphide ores are converted into oxides by heating strongly\nin the pr esence of excess air . This pr ocess is known as r oasting. The\ncarbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited\nair. This pr ocess is known as calcination. The chemical r eaction that\ntakes place during roasting and calcination of zinc ores can be shown\nas follows \u2013\nRoasting\n2ZnS(s) + 3O (g) 2ZnO(s) + 2SO (g)2 2Heat\uf8e7 \u2192 \uf8e7\uf8e7 \uf8e7\nCalcination\nZnCO (s) ZnO(s) + CO (g)3 2Heat\uf8e7 \u2192 \uf8e7\uf8e7 \uf8e7\nThe metal oxides are then reduced to the corresponding metals by\nusing suitable reducing agents such as carbon. For example, when zinc\noxide is heated with carbon, it is reduced to metallic zinc.\nZnO(s) + C(s) \u2192 Zn(s) + CO(g)\nYou ar e already familiar with the pr ocess of oxidation and r eduction\nexplained in the first Chapter . Obtaining metals fr om their compounds\nis also a reduction process.\nBesides using carbon (coke) to reduce metal oxides to metals,\nsometimes displacement reactions can also be used. The highly reactive\nmetals such as sodium, calcium, aluminium, etc., are used as reducing\n2024-25\n\nScience 52agents because they can displace metals of lower reactivity from their\ncompounds. For example, when manganese dioxide is heated with\naluminium powder , the following reaction takes place \u2013\n3MnO2(s) + 4Al(s) \u2192 3Mn(l) + 2Al2O3(s) + Heat\nCan you identify the substances that are getting oxidised\nand reduced?\nThese displacement reactions are highly exothermic. The\namount of heat evolved is so large that the metals are produced\nin the molten state. In fact, the reaction of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3)\nwith aluminium is used to join railway tracks or cracked\nmachine parts. This reaction is known as the thermit reaction.\nFe2O3(s) + 2Al(s) \u2192 2Fe(l) + Al2O3(s) + Heat\n3.4.5 Extracting Metals towards the T op of the\nActivity Series\nThe metals high up in the reactivity series are very reactive. They cannot\nbe obtained from their compounds by heating with carbon. For example,\ncarbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium, magnesium, calcium,\naluminium, etc., to the respective metals. This is because these metals\nhave more affinity for oxygen than carbon. These metals are obtained\nby electrolytic reduction. For example, sodium, magnesium and calcium\nare obtained by the electrolysis of their molten chlorides. The metals\nare deposited at the cathode (the negatively charged electrode), whereas,\nchlorine is liberated at the anode (the positively charged electrode). The\nreactions are  \u2013\nAt cathode Na+ + e\u2013\u2192Na\nAt anode       2Cl \u2013\u2192Cl2 + 2e\u2013\nSimilarly, aluminium is obtained by the electrolytic reduction of\naluminium oxide.\n3.4.6 Refining of Metals\nThe metals produced by various reduction processes\ndescribed above are not very pure. They contain\nimpurities, which must be removed to obtain pure metals.\nThe most widely used method for refining impure metals\nis electrolytic refining.\nElectrolytic Refining: Electrolytic Refining: Electrolytic Refining: Electrolytic Refining: Electrolytic Refining: Many metals, such as copper , zinc,\ntin, nickel, silver , gold, etc., ar e refined electr olytically. In\nthis process, the impure metal is made the anode and a\nthin strip of pure metal is made the cathode. A solution of\nthe metal salt is used as an electrolyte. The apparatus is\nset up as shown in Fig. 3.12. On passing the current\nthrough the electrolyte, the pure metal from the anode\ndissolves into the electrolyte. An equivalent amount of pure\nFigure 3.11Figure 3.11Figure 3.11Figure 3.11Figure 3.11\nThermit process for\njoining railway tracks\nFigure 3.12Figure 3.12Figure 3.12Figure 3.12Figure 3.12\nElectr olytic r efining of copper .

It is, therefore, not suitable for making\njewellery. It is alloyed with either silver or copper to make it hard. Generally, in India,\n22 carat gold is used for making ornaments. It means that 22 parts of pure gold is\nalloyed with 2 parts of either copper or silver .\nIf one of the metals is mercury, then the alloy is known as an\namalgam. The electrical conductivity and melting point of an alloy is\nless than that of pure metals. For example, brass, an alloy of copper and\nzinc (Cu and Zn), and bronze, an alloy of copper and tin (Cu and Sn), are\nnot good conductors of electricity whereas copper is used for making\nelectrical cir cuits. Solder , an alloy of lead and tin (Pb and Sn), has a low\nmelting point and is used for welding electrical wir es together .\n3.5.1 Prevention of Corrosion\nThe rusting of iron can be prevented by painting, oiling, greasing,\ngalvanising, chrome plating, anodising or making alloys.\nGalvanisation is a method of protecting steel and iron from rusting\nby coating them with a thin layer of zinc. The galvanised article is\nprotected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you\nreason this out?\nAlloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal.\nWe can get the desir ed pr operties by this method. For example, iron is\nthe most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is\nbecause pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot. But, if it is\nmixed with a small amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes hard\nand strong. When iron is mixed with nickel and chromium, we get\nstainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed\nwith some other substance, its properties change. In fact, the properties\nof any metal can be changed if it is mixed with some other substance.\nThe substance added may be a metal or a non-metal. An alloy is a\nhomogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a non-\nmetal. It is prepared by first melting the primary metal, and then,\ndissolving the other elements in it in definite proportions. It is then cooled\nto room temperature.\nIron pillar at DelhiThe wonder of ancient Indian metallurgy\nThe iron pillar near the Qutub Minar in Delhi was built more\nthan 1600 years ago by the iron workers of India.  They had\ndeveloped a process which prevented iron from rusting. For\nits quality of rust resistance it has been examined by scientists\nfrom all parts of the world.

What does it mean?  It means that\nthe electric current through the copper wire has produced a magnetic\neffect. Thus we can say that electricity and magnetism are linked to each\nother . Then, what about the r everse possibility of an electric ef fect of\nmoving magnets? In this Chapter we will study magnetic fields and such\nelectr omagnetic ef fects. W e shall also study about electr omagnets which\ninvolve the magnetic effect of electric current.\nHans Christian Oersted (1777\u20131851)\nHans Christian Oersted, one of the leading scientists of the 19th\ncentury, played a crucial role in understanding  electromagnetism . In\n1820 he accidentally discovered that a compass needle got deflected\nwhen an electric current passed through a metallic wire placed nearby.\nThrough this observation Oersted showed that electricity and\nmagnetism were related phenomena.

A compass needle is, in fact, a small bar\nmagnet. The ends of the compass needle point approximately towards\nnorth and south directions. The end pointing towards north is called north\nseeking  or north pole. The other end that points towards south is called\nsouth seeking  or south pole. Through various activities we have observed\nthat like poles r epel, while unlike poles of magnets attract each other .\nQUESTION\n?1.

Why do the iron filings arrange in such a pattern? What does\nthis pattern demonstrate?  The magnet exerts its influence in the region\nsurrounding it.  Therefore the iron filings experience a force.  The force\nthus exerted makes iron filings to arrange in a pattern. The region\nsurrounding a magnet, in which the force of the magnet can be detected,\nis said to have a magnetic field.  The lines along which the iron filings\nalign themselves represent magnetic field lines.\nAre there other ways of obtaining magnetic field lines around a bar\nmagnet?  Y es, you can yourself draw the field lines of a bar magnet.\nActivity 12.3Activity 12.3Activity 12.3Activity 12.3Activity 12.3\n/square6Take a small compass and a bar magnet.\n/square6Place the magnet on a sheet of white paper fixed on a drawing\nboard, using some adhesive material.\n/square6Mark the boundary of the magnet.\n/square6Place the compass near the north pole of the magnet. How does\nit behave? The south pole of the needle points towards the north\npole of the magnet. The north pole of the compass is directed\naway from the north pole of the magnet.\n2024-25\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current 197Magnetic field is a quantity that has both direction and magnitude.\nThe direction of the magnetic field is taken to be the direction in which a\nnorth pole of the compass needle moves inside it.  Therefore it is taken\nby convention that the field lines emerge from north pole and merge at\nthe south pole (note the arrows marked on the field lines in Fig. 12.4).\nInside the magnet, the direction of field lines is from its south pole to its\nnorth pole. Thus the magnetic field lines are closed curves.\nThe relative strength of the magnetic field is shown by the degree of\ncloseness of the field lines. The field is str onger , that is, the for ce acting\non the pole of another magnet placed is greater where the field lines are\ncrowded (see Fig. 12.4).\nNo two field-lines ar e found to cr oss each other . If they did, it would\nmean that at the point of intersection, the compass needle would point\ntowards two directions, which is not possible.\n12.2\n12.212.2 12.212.2 MA MAMA MAMAGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENTGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENTGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENTGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENTGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENT --- --C CC CCARRYING ARRYINGARRYING ARRYINGARRYING\nCONDUCTORCONDUCTORCONDUCTORCONDUCTORCONDUCTOR\nIn Activity 12.1, we have seen that an electric current through a\nmetallic conductor produces a magnetic field around it. In order to\nfind the direction of the field produced let us repeat the activity in the\nfollowing way  \u2013Figure 12.3Figure 12.3Figure 12.3Figure 12.3Figure 12.3\nDrawing a magnetic field line with the help of a\ncompass needle/square6Mark the position of two ends of the needle.\n/square6Now move the needle to a new position\nsuch that its south pole occupies the\nposition previously occupied by its north\npole.\n/square6In this way, proceed step by step till you\nreach the south pole of the magnet as\nshown in Fig. 12.3.\n/square6Join the points marked on the paper by a\nsmooth curve.  This curve represents\na field line.\n/square6Repeat the above procedure and draw as\nmany lines as you can. Y ou will get a\npattern shown in Fig. 12.4. These lines\nrepresent the magnetic field around the\nmagnet. These are known as magnetic\nfield lines.\n/square6Observe the deflection in the compass\nneedle as you move it along a field line.\nThe deflection increases as the needle is\nmoved towards the poles.\nFigure 12.4Figure 12.4Figure 12.4Figure 12.4Figure 12.4\nField lines around a bar magnet\n2024-25\n\nScience 19812.2.1 Magnetic Field due to a Current through a Straight\nConductor\nWhat determines the pattern of the magnetic field generated by a current\nthrough a conductor? Does the pattern depend on the shape of the\nconductor? W e shall investigate this with an activity.\nWe shall first consider the patter n of the magnetic field ar ound a\nstraight conductor carrying current.Activity 12.4Activity 12.4Activity 12.4Activity 12.4Activity 12.4\n/square6Take a long straight copper wire, two or three cells of 1.5 V each, and a plug key. Connect\nall of them in series as shown in Fig. 12.5 (a).\n/square6Place the straight wire parallel to and over a compass needle.\n/square6Plug the key in the circuit.\n/square6Observe the direction of deflection of the north pole of the needle. If the current flows from\nnorth to south, as shown in Fig. 12.5 (a), the north pole of the compass needle would move\ntowards the east.\n/square6Replace the cell connections in the circuit as shown in Fig. 12.5 (b). This would result in\nthe change of the direction of current through the copper wire, that is, from south to\nnorth.\n/square6Observe the change in the dir ection of deflection of the needle. Y ou will see that now the\nneedle moves in opposite direction, that is, towards the west [Fig. 12.5 (b)]. It means that\nthe direction of magnetic field produced by the electric current is also reversed.\nFigure 12.5Figure 12.5Figure 12.5Figure 12.5Figure 12.5 A simple electric circuit in which a straight copper wire is placed parallel to and over a compass\nneedle. The deflection in the needle becomes opposite when the direction of the current is reversed.(a) (b)\nActivity 12.5Activity 12.5Activity 12.5Activity 12.5Activity 12.5\n/square6Take a battery (12 V), a variable resistance (or a rheostat), an\nammeter (0\u20135 A), a plug key, connecting wires and a long straight\nthick copper wire.\n/square6Insert the thick wire through the centre, normal to the plane of a\nrectangular cardboard.  Take care that the cardboard is fixed and\ndoes not slide up or down.\n2024-25\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current 199What happens to the deflection of the compass needle placed at a\ngiven point if the current in the copper wire is changed? To see this, vary\nthe curr ent in the wir\ne. We find that the deflection in the needle also\nchanges. In fact, if the current is increased, the deflection also increases.\nIt indicates that the magnitude of the magnetic field produced at a given\npoint increases as the current through the wire increases.\nWhat happens to the deflection of the needle if the compass is moved\naway from the copper wire but the current through the wire remains the\nsame? To see this, now place the compass at a farther point from the\nconducting wire (say at point Q). What change do you observe? W e see\nthat the deflection in the needle decreases. Thus the magnetic field\nproduced by a given current in the conductor decreases as the distance\nfrom it increases. From Fig. 12.6, it can be noticed that the concentric\ncircles representing the magnetic field around a current-carrying straight\nwire become larger and larger as we move away from it.\n12.2.2 Right-Hand Thumb Rule\nA convenient way of finding the direction of magnetic field associated\nwith a current-carrying conductor is  given in Fig. 12.7./square6Connect the copper wire vertically between the\npoints X and Y, as shown in Fig. 12.6 (a), in\nseries with the battery, a plug and key.\n/square6Sprinkle some iron filings uniformly on the\ncardboar d. (You may use a salt sprinkler for this\npurpose.)\n/square6Keep the variable of the rheostat at a fixed\nposition and note the current through the\nammeter .\n/square6Close the key so that a current flows through\nthe wire. Ensure that the copper wire placed\nbetween the points X and Y remains vertically\nstraight.\n/square6Gently tap the cardboard a few times. Observe\nthe patter n of the ir on filings. Y ou would find\nthat the iron filings align themselves showing\na pattern of concentric circles around the\ncopper wire (Fig. 12.6).\n/square6What do these concentric circles represent?\nThey represent the magnetic field lines.\n/square6How can the direction of the magnetic field be\nfound? Place a compass at a point (say P) over\na circle. Observe the direction of the needle. The\ndirection of the north pole of the compass\nneedle would give the direction of the field lines\nproduced by the electric current through the\nstraight wir e at point P . Show the dir ection by\nan arrow.\n/square6Does the direction of magnetic field lines get\nreversed if the direction of current through the\nstraight copper wire is reversed? Check it.\nFigure 12.6Figure 12.6Figure 12.6Figure 12.6Figure 12.6\n(a) A pattern of concentric circles indicating\nthe field lines of a magnetic field around a\nstraight conducting wire.

Then your fingers will wrap around the\nconductor in the direction of the field lines of the magnetic field, as\nshown in Fig. 12.7. This is known as the right-hand thumb rule *.\nExample 12.1\nA current through a horizontal power line flows in east to west\ndirection. What is the direction of magnetic field at a point directly\nbelow it and at a point directly above it?\nSolution\nThe current is in the east-west direction. Applying the right-hand\nthumb rule, we get that the magnetic field (at any point below or\nabove the wire) turns clockwise in a plane perpendicular to the wire,\nwhen viewed from the east end, and anti-clockwise, when viewed\nfrom the west end.Figure 12.7Figure 12.7Figure 12.7Figure 12.7Figure 12.7\nRight-hand thumb rule\n*This rule is also called Maxwell\u2019s corkscrew rule. If we consider ourselves driving a\ncorkscrew in the direction of the current, then the direction of the rotation of\ncorkscrew is the direction of the magnetic field.12.2.3 Magnetic Field due to a Current through a\nCircular Loop\nWe have so far observed the patter n of the magnetic field lines\nproduced around a current-carrying straight wire. Suppose\nthis straight wire is bent in the form of a circular loop and a\ncurrent is passed through it. How would the magnetic field\nlines look like? W e know that the magnetic field pr\noduced\nby a current-carrying straight wire depends inversely on the\ndistance from it. Similarly at every point of a current-carrying\ncircular loop, the concentric circles representing the magnetic\nfield around it would become larger and larger as we move\naway from the wire (Fig. 12.8). By the time we reach at the\ncentre of the circular loop, the arcs of these big circles would\nappear as straight lines. Every point on the wire carrying\ncurrent would give rise to the magnetic field appearing as\nstraight lines at the center of the loop. By applying the right\nhand rule, it is easy to check that every section of the wire\ncontributes to the magnetic field lines in the same direction\nwithin the loop.Figure 12.8Figure 12.8Figure 12.8Figure 12.8Figure 12.8\nMagnetic field lines of the field\nproduced by a current-carrying\ncircular loop?QUESTIONS\n1. Draw magnetic field lines around a bar magnet.\n2. List the properties of magnetic field lines.\n3. Why don\u2019t two magnetic field lines intersect each other?\n2024-25\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current 201We know that the magnetic field pr oduced by a curr ent-carrying\nwire at a given point depends directly on the current passing through it.\nTherefore, if there is a circular coil having n turns, the field produced is\nn times as large as that produced by a single turn. This is because the\ncurrent in each circular turn has the same direction, and the field due to\neach turn then just adds up.\nActivity 12.6Activity 12.6Activity 12.6Activity 12.6Activity 12.6\n/square6Take a rectangular cardboard having two holes.\nInsert a circular coil having large number of turns\nthrough them, normal to the plane of the cardboard.\n/square6Connect the ends of the coil in series with a battery,\na key and a rheostat, as shown in Fig. 12.9.\n/square6Sprinkle iron filings uniformly on the cardboard.\n/square6Plug the key.\n/square6Tap the cardboard gently a few times. Note the\npattern of the iron filings that emerges on the\ncardboard.Figure 12.9Figure 12.9Figure 12.9Figure 12.9Figure 12.9\nMagnetic field produced by a current-\ncarrying circular coil.\n12.2.4 Magnetic Field due to a Current in a Solenoid\nA coil of many circular turns of insulated copper wire wrapped\nclosely in the shape of a cylinder is called a solenoid. The pattern\nof the magnetic field lines around a current-carrying solenoid is\nshown in Fig. 12.10. Compare the pattern of the field with the\nmagnetic field around a bar magnet (Fig. 12.4). Do they look\nsimilar? Y es, they ar\ne similar . In fact, one end of the solenoid\nbehaves as a magnetic north pole, while the other behaves as the\nsouth pole. The field lines inside the solenoid are in the form of\nparallel straight lines. This indicates that the magnetic field is\nthe same at all points inside the solenoid. That is, the field is\nuniform inside the solenoid.\nA strong magnetic field produced inside a solenoid can be\nused to magnetise a piece of magnetic material, like soft iron,\nwhen placed inside the coil (Fig. 12.11). The magnet so formed is\ncalled an electromagnet.Figure 12.10Figure 12.10Figure 12.10Figure 12.10Figure 12.10\nField lines of the magnetic field\nthrough and around a current\ncarrying solenoid.\nFigure 12.11Figure 12.11Figure 12.11Figure 12.11Figure 12.11\nA current-carrying solenoid coil\nis used to magnetise steel rod\ninside it \u2013 an electromagnet.QUESTIONS\n?1. Consider a circular loop of wire lying in\nthe plane of the table. Let the current\npass through the loop clockwise.

The field so produced exerts a force on a\nmagnet placed in the vicinity of the conductor . French scientist Andre\nMarie Ampere (1775\u20131836) suggested that the magnet must also exert\nan equal and opposite for ce on the curr ent-carrying conductor . The for ce\ndue to a magnetic field acting on a current-carrying conductor can be\ndemonstrated through the following activity.3. Choose the correct option.\nThe magnetic field inside a long straight solenoid-carrying current\n(a) is zero.\n(b) decreases as we move towards its end.\n(c) increases as we move towards its end.\n(d) is the same at all points.\nActivity 12.7Activity 12.7Activity 12.7Activity 12.7Activity 12.7\n/square6Take a small aluminium rod AB (of about 5 cm). Using\ntwo connecting wires suspend it horizontally from a\nstand, as shown in Fig. 12.12.\n/square6Place a strong horse-shoe magnet in such a way that\nthe rod lies between the two poles with the magnetic\nfield directed upwards. For this put the north pole of\nthe magnet vertically below and south pole vertically\nabove the aluminium rod (Fig. 12.12).\n/square6Connect the aluminium rod in series with a battery,\na key and a rheostat.\n/square6Now pass a current through the aluminium rod from\nend B to end A.\n/square6What do you observe? It is observed that the rod is\ndisplaced towar ds the left. Y ou will notice that the r od\ngets displaced.\n/square6Reverse the direction of current flowing through the\nrod and observe the direction of its displacement. It is\nnow towards the right.\nWhy does the rod get displaced?Figure 12.12Figure 12.12Figure 12.12Figure 12.12Figure 12.12\nA current-carrying rod, AB, experiences\na force perpendicular to its length and\nthe magnetic field. Support for the\nmagnet is not shown here, for simplicity.\nThe displacement of the rod in the above activity suggests that a\nforce is exerted on the current-carrying aluminium rod when it is placed\nin a magnetic field. It also suggests that the direction of force is also\nreversed when the direction of current through the conductor is reversed.\nNow change the direction of field to vertically downwards by\ninterchanging the two poles of the magnet. It is once again observed that\n2024-25\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current 203the direction of force acting on the current-carrying rod gets reversed. It\nshows that the direction of the force on the conductor depends upon the\ndirection of current and the direction of the magnetic field. Experiments\nhave shown that the displacement of the rod is largest (or the magnitude\nof the force is the highest) when the direction of current is at right angles\nto the direction of the magnetic field. In such a condition we can use a\nsimple rule to find the dir ection of the for ce on the conductor .\nIn Activity 12.7, we considered the\ndirection of the current and that of the magnetic\nfield perpendicular to each other and found\nthat the force is perpendicular to both of them.\nThe three directions can be illustrated through\na simple rule, called Fleming\u2019s left-hand rule.\nAccording to this rule, stretch the thumb,\nforefinger and middle finger of your left hand\nsuch that they are mutually perpendicular\n(Fig. 12.13). If the first finger points in the\ndirection of magnetic field and the second\nfinger in the direction of current, then the\nthumb will point in the direction of motion or\nthe for ce acting on the conductor .\nDevices that use current-carrying conductors and magnetic fields\ninclude electric motor , electric generator , loudspeakers, micr\nophones\nand measuring instruments.\nExample 12.2\nAn electron enters a magnetic field at right angles to it, as shown\nin Fig. 12.14. The direction of force acting on the electron will be\n(a) to the right.\n(b)to the left.\n(c)out of the page.\n(d)into the page.\nSolution\nAnswer is option (d). The direction of force is perpendicular to the\ndirection of magnetic field and current as given by Fleming\u2019s left hand\nrule. Recall that the direction of current is taken opposite to the direction\nof motion of electrons. The force is therefore directed into the page.Figure 12.13Figure 12.13Figure 12.13Figure 12.13Figure 12.13\nFleming\u2019s left-hand rule\nFigure 12.14Figure 12.14Figure 12.14Figure 12.14Figure 12.14\nQUESTIONS\n?1.

One of the wires in this supply, usually with\nred insulation cover , is called live wir e (or positive). Another wir e, with\nblack insulation, is called neutral wire (or negative). In our country, the\npotential dif ference between the two is 220 V .\nAt the meter -boar d in the house, these wir es pass into an electricity\nmeter through a main fuse. Through the main switch they are connected\nto the line wires in the house. These wires supply electricity to separate\ncircuits within the house. Often, two separate circuits are used, one of\n15 A current rating for appliances with higher power ratings such as\ngeysers, air coolers, etc. The other circuit is of 5 A current rating for\nbulbs, fans, etc. The earth wir e, which has insulation of gr een colour , is\nusually connected to a metal plate deep in the earth near the house.\nThis is used as a safety measure, especially for those appliances that\nhave a metallic body, for example, electric pr\ness, toaster , table fan,\nrefrigerator , etc. The metallic body is connected to the earth wir e, which\nprovides a low-resistance conducting path for the current. Thus, it\nensures that any leakage of current to the metallic body of the appliance\nkeeps its potential to that of the earth, and the user may not get a severe\nelectric shock.2. In Activity 12.7, how do we think the displacement of rod AB will be\naffected if (i) current in rod AB is increased; (ii) a stronger horse-shoe\nmagnet is used; and (iii) length of the rod AB is increased?\n3. A positively-charged particle (alpha-particle) projected towards west is\ndeflected towards north by a magnetic field.

Even weak ion currents that\ntravel along the nerve cells in our body produce magnetic fields. When we touch\nsomething, our nerves carry an electric impulse to the muscles we need to use. This\nimpulse produces a temporary magnetic field. These fields are very weak and are\nabout one-billionth of the earth\u2019s magnetic field. Two main organs in the human\nbody where the magnetic field produced is significant , are the heart and the brain. The\nmagnetic field inside the body forms the basis of obtaining the images of different body\nparts. This is done using a technique called Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Analysis\nof these images helps in medical diagnosis. Magnetism has, thus, got important uses\nin medicine.More to Know!\n2024-25\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current 205Figure 12.15Figure 12.15Figure 12.15Figure 12.15Figure 12.15  A schematic diagram of one of the common domestic circuits\nQUESTIONS\n?Figure 12.15 gives a schematic diagram of one of the common\ndomestic circuits. In each separate circuit, different appliances can be\nconnected across the live and neutral wires. Each appliance has a\nseparate switch to \u2018ON\u2019/\u2018OFF\u2019 the flow of current through it. In order\nthat each appliance has equal potential difference, they are connected\nparallel to each other .\nElectric fuse is an important component of all domestic cir cuits. W e\nhave already studied the principle and working of a fuse in the previous\nchapter (see Section 11.7). A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the\nappliances and the circuit due to overloading. Overloading can occur\nwhen the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact. (This\noccurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the\nappliance.) In such a situation, the current in the circuit abruptly\nincreases. This is called short-circuiting. The use of an electric fuse\nprevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage\nby stopping the flow of unduly high electric current. The Joule heating\nthat takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit.\nOverloading can also occur due to an accidental hike in the supply\nvoltage. Sometimes overloading is caused by connecting too many\nappliances to a single socket.\n1. Name two safety measures commonly used in electric circuits and\nappliances.\n2.

            "text": "Science 100Control and\nCoordination6 CHAPTER\nIn the pr evious chapter , we looked at life pr ocesses involved in the\nmaintenance functions in living organisms. There, we had started with\na notion we all have, that if we see something moving, it is alive. Some of\nthese movements are in fact the result of growth, as in plants. A seed\ngerminates and grows, and we can see that the seedling moves over the\ncourse of a few days, it pushes soil aside and comes out. But if its growth\nwere to be stopped, these movements would not happen. Some\nmovements, as in many animals and some plants, are not connected\nwith growth. A cat running, children playing on swings, buffaloes\nchewing cud \u2013 these are not movements caused by growth.\nWhy do we associate such visible movements with life? A possible\nanswer is that we think of movement as a response to a change in the\nenvironment of the organism. The cat may be running because it has\nseen a mouse.  Not only that, we also think of movement as an attempt\nby living organisms to use changes in their environment to their\nadvantage. Plants grow out into the sunshine. Children try to get pleasure\nand fun out of swinging. Buffaloes chew cud to help break up tough\nfood so as to be able to digest it better . When bright light is focussed on\nour eyes or when we touch a hot object, we detect the change and respond\nto it with movement in order to protect ourselves.\nIf we think a bit more about this, it becomes apparent that all this\nmovement, in response to the environment, is carefully controlled. Each\nkind of a change in the environment evokes an appropriate movement\nin response. When we want to talk to our friends in class, we whisper ,\nrather than shouting loudly. Clearly, the movement to be made depends\non the event that is triggering it. Therefore, such controlled movement\nmust be connected to the recognition of various events in the\nenvironment, followed by only the correct movement in response. In other\nwords, living organisms must use systems providing control and\ncoordination. In keeping with the general principles of body organisation\nin multicellular organisms, specialised tissues are used to provide these\ncontrol and coordination activities.\n6.1\n6.16.1 6.16.1ANIMALS \u2013 NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS \u2013 NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS \u2013 NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS \u2013 NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS \u2013 NERVOUS SYSTEM\nIn animals, such control and coordination are provided by nervous and\nmuscular tissues, which we have studied  in Class IX. Touching a hot\n2024-25\n\nControl and Coordination 101object is an urgent and dangerous\nsituation for us. W e need to detect it,\nand respond to it. How do we detect that\nwe are touching a hot object? All\ninformation from our environment is\ndetected by the specialised tips of some\nnerve cells. These receptors are usually\nlocated in our sense organs, such as the\ninner ear , the nose, the tongue, and so\non. So gustatory receptors will detect taste\nwhile olfactory receptors will detect smell.\nThis information, acquired at the\nend of the dendritic tip of a nerve cell\n[Fig. 6.1 (a)],  sets off a chemical reaction\nthat creates an electrical impulse. This\nimpulse travels from the dendrite to the\ncell body, and then along the axon to its\nend. At the end of the axon, the electrical\nimpulse sets off the release of some\nchemicals. These chemicals cross the\ngap, or synapse, and start a similar\nelectrical impulse in a dendrite of the next\nneuron. This is a general scheme of how\nnervous impulses travel in the body. A\nsimilar synapse finally allows delivery of such impulses from neurons to\nother cells, such as muscles cells or gland  [Fig. 6.1 (b)].\nIt is thus no surprise that nervous tissue is made up of an organised\nnetwork of nerve cells or neurons, and is specialised for conducting\ninformation via electrical impulses fr om one part of the body to another .\nLook at Fig. 6.1 (a) and identify the parts of a neuron (i) where\ninformation is acquired, (ii) through which information travels as an\nelectrical impulse, and (iii) where this impulse must be converted into a\nchemical signal for onward transmi ssion.\nActivity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1\n/square6Put some sugar in your mouth.

If so, why might this be happening? Read and talk about\npossible explanations for these kinds of differences. Do you come across\na similar situation when you have a cold?\nFigure 6.1 Figure 6.1 Figure 6.1 Figure 6.1 Figure 6.1 (a) Structure of neuron, (b)      Neuromuscular\njunction(a)\n(b)\n2024-25\n\nScience 1026.1.1 What happens in Reflex Actions?\n\u2018Reflex\u2019 is a word we use very commonly when we talk about some sudden\naction in r esponse to something in the envir onment. W e say \u2018I jumped\nout of the way of the bus reflexly\u2019, or \u2018I pulled my hand back from the\nflame reflexly\u2019, or \u2018I was so hungry my mouth started watering reflexly\u2019.\nWhat exactly do we mean? A common idea in all such examples is that\nwe do something without thinking about it, or without feeling in control\nof our r eactions. Y et these ar e situations wher e we ar e responding with\nsome action to changes in our environment. How is control and\ncoordination achieved in such situations?\nLet us consider this further . Take one of our examples. T\nouching a\nflame is an urgent and dangerous situation for us, or in fact, for any\nanimal! How would we respond to this? One seemingly simple way is to\nthink consciously about the pain and the possibility of getting burnt,\nand therefore move our hand. An important question then is, how long\nwill it take us to think all this? The answer depends on how we think.  If\nnerve impulses ar e sent ar ound the way we have talked about earlier ,\nthen thinking is also likely to involve the creation of such impulses.\nThinking is a complex activity, so it is bound to involve a complicated\ninteraction of many nerve impulses from many neurons.\nIf this is the case, it is no surprise that the thinking tissue in our\nbody consists of dense networks of intricately arranged neurons. It sits\nin the forward end of the skull, and receives signals from all over the\nbody which it thinks about before responding to them. Obviously, in\norder to receive these signals, this thinking part of the brain in the skull\nmust be connected to nerves coming from various parts of the body.\nSimilarly, if this part of the brain is to instruct muscles to move, nerves\nmust carry this signal back to different parts of the body. If all of this is\nto be done when we touch a hot object, it may take enough time for us to\nget burnt!\nHow does the design of the body solve this problem? Rather than\nhaving to think about the sensation of heat, if the nerves that detect heat\nwere to be connected to the nerves that move muscles in a simpler way,\nthe process of detecting the signal or the input and responding to it by\nan output action might be completed quickly. Such a connection is\ncommonly called a reflex arc (Fig. 6.2). Where should such reflex arc\nconnections be made between the input nerve and the output nerve?\nThe best place, of course, would be at the point where they first meet\neach other . Nerves fr om all over the body meet in a bundle in the spinal\ncord on their way to the brain. Reflex arcs are formed in this spinal cord\nitself, although the information input also goes on to reach the brain.\nOf course, reflex arcs have evolved in animals because the thinking\nprocess of the brain is not fast enough.  In fact many animals have very\nlittle or none of the complex neuron network needed for thinking. So it is\nquite likely that reflex arcs have evolved as efficient ways of functioning\nin the absence of true thought pr ocesses.  However , even after complex\nneuron networks have come into existence, reflex arcs continue to be\nmore efficient for quick responses.\n2024-25\n\nControl and Coordination 103Can you now trace the sequence of events which occur when a bright\nlight is focussed on your eyes?\n6.1.2 Human Brain\nIs reflex action the only function of the spinal cord? Obviously not, since\nwe know that we are thinking beings. Spinal cord is made up of nerves\nwhich supply information to think about. Thinking involves more\ncomplex mechanisms and neural connections. These are concentrated\nin the brain, which is the main coordinating centre of the body.  The\nbrain and spinal cord constitute the central nervous system (Fig. 6.3).\nThey receive information from all parts of the body and integrate it.\nWe also think about our actions. W riting, talking, moving a chair ,\nclapping at the end of a programme are examples of voluntary actions\nwhich are based on deciding what to do next.  So, the brain also has to\nsend messages to muscles.  This is the second way in which the nervous\nsystem communicates with the muscles.  The communication between\nthe central nervous system and the other parts of the body is facilitated\nby the peripheral nervous system consisting of cranial nerves arising\nfrom the brain and spinal nerves arising from the spinal cord. The brain\nthus allows us to think and take actions based on that thinking.  As you\nwill expect, this is accomplished through a complex design, with different\nparts of the brain responsible for integrating different inputs and outputs.\nThe brain has three such major parts or regions, namely the fore-brain,\nmid-brain and hind-brain.\nThe fore-brain is the main thinking part of the brain. It has regions\nwhich receive sensory impulses from various receptors. Separate areas\nof the fore-brain are specialised for hearing, smell, sight and so on.  There\nare separate areas of association where this sensory information is\ninterpreted by putting it together with information from other receptors\nas well as with information that is already stored in the brain.  Based onFigure 6.2 Figure 6.2 Figure 6.2 Figure 6.2 Figure 6.2 Reflex arc\n2024-25\n\nScience 104all this, a decision is made about how to respond and the information is\npassed on to the motor areas which control the movement of voluntary\nmuscles, for example, our leg muscles.  However , certain sensations ar e\ndistinct from seeing or hearing, for example, how do we know that we\nhave eaten enough? The sensation of feeling full is because of a centre\nassociated with  hunger , which is in a separate part of the for e-brain.\nStudy the labelled diagram of the human brain. W e have seen that\nthe different parts have specific functions. Can we find out the function\nof each part?\nLet us look at the other use of the word \u2018reflex\u2019 that we have talked\nabout in the introduction. Our mouth waters when we see food we like\nwithout our meaning to. Our hearts beat without our thinking about it.\nIn fact, we cannot control these actions easily by thinking about them\neven if we wanted to. Do we have to think about or remember to breathe\nor digest food? So, in between the simple reflex actions like change in\nthe size of the pupil, and the thought out actions such as moving a\nchair , ther e is another set of muscle movements over which we do not\nhave any thinking control. Many of these involuntary actions are\ncontrolled by the mid-brain and hind-brain. All these involuntary actions\nincluding blood pressure, salivation and vomiting are controlled by the\nmedulla in the hind-brain.\nThink about activities like walking in a straight line, riding a bicycle,\npicking up a pencil. These are possible due to a part of the hind-brain\ncalled the cerebellum. It is responsible for precision of voluntary actions\nand maintaining the posture and balance of the body. Imagine what\nwould happen if each of these events failed to take place if we were not\nthinking about it.Figure 6.3Figure 6.3Figure 6.3Figure 6.3Figure 6.3  Human brain\n2024-25\n\nControl and Coordination 1056.1.3 How are these Tissues protected?\nA delicate organ like the brain, which is so important for a variety of\nactivities, needs to be carefully protected. For this, the body is designed\nso that the brain sits inside a bony box. Inside the box, the brain is\ncontained in a fluid-filled balloon which provides further shock\nabsorption. If you run your hand down the middle of your back, you\nwill feel a hard, bumpy structure. This is the vertebral column or\nbackbone which protects the spinal cord.\n6.1.4 How does the Nervous Tissue cause Action?\nSo far , we have been talking about nervous tissue, and how it collects\ninformation, sends it around the body, processes information, makes\ndecisions based on information, and conveys decisions to muscles for\naction. In other words, when the action or movement is to be performed,\nmuscle tissue will do the final job. How do animal muscles move? When\na nerve impulse reaches the muscle, the muscle fibre must move. How\ndoes a muscle cell move? The simplest notion of movement at the cellular\nlevel is that muscle cells will move by changing their shape so that they\nshorten. So the next question is, how do muscle cells change their shape?\nThe answer must lie in the chemistry of cellular components. Muscle\ncells have special proteins that change both their shape and their\narrangement in the cell in response to nervous electrical impulses. When\nthis happens, new arrangements of these proteins give the muscle cells\na shorter form. Remember when we talked about muscle tissue in\nClass IX, there were different kinds of muscles, such as voluntary muscles\nand involuntary muscles. Based on what we have discussed so far , what\ndo you think the differences between these would be?\nQUESTIONS\n?1. What is the difference between a reflex action and walking?\n2. What happens at the synapse between two neurons?\n3. Which part of the brain maintains posture and equilibrium of the body?\n4. How do we detect the smell of an agarbatti (incense stick)?\n5. What is the role of the brain in reflex action?\n6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA TION IN PLTION IN PLTION IN PLTION IN PLTION IN PL ANTSANTSANTS\nANTSANTS\nAnimals have a nervous system for controlling and coordinating the\nactivities of the body. But plants have neither a nervous system nor\nmuscles. So, how do they respond to stimuli? When we touch the leaves\nof a chhui-mui  (the \u2018sensitive\u2019 or \u2018touch-me-not\u2019 plant of the Mimosa\nfamily), they begin to fold up and droop. When a seed germinates, the\nroot goes down, the stem comes up into the air . What happens? Firstly,\nthe leaves of the sensitive plant move very quickly in response to touch.\n2024-25\n\nScience 106There is no growth involved in this movement. On the other hand, the\ndirectional movement of a seedling is caused by growth. If it is prevented\nfrom growing, it will not show any movement. So plants show two different\ntypes of movement \u2013 one dependent on growth and the other independent\nof growth.\n6.2.1 Immediate Response to Stimulus\nLet us think about the first kind of movement, such as that of the sensitive\nplant. Since no growth is involved, the plant must actually move its leaves\nin response to touch. But there is no nervous tissue, nor any muscle\ntissue. How does the plant detect the touch, and how do the leaves move\nin response?\nFigure 6.4Figure 6.4Figure 6.4Figure 6.4Figure 6.4  The sensitive plant\nIf we think about where exactly the plant is touched, and what part\nof the plant actually moves, it is apparent that movement happens at a\npoint different from the point of touch. So, information that a touch has\noccurred must be communicated. The plants also use electrical-chemical\nmeans to convey this information from cell to cell, but unlike in animals,\nthere is no specialised tissue in plants for the conduction of information.\nFinally, again as in animals, some cells must change shape in order for\nmovement to happen. Instead of the specialised proteins found in animal\nmuscle cells, plant cells change shape by changing the amount of water\nin them, resulting in swelling or shrinking, and therefore in changing\nshapes (Fig. 6.4).\n6.2.2 Movement Due to Growth\nSome plants like the pea plant climb up other plants or fences by means\nof tendrils. These tendrils are sensitive to touch. When they come in\ncontact with any support, the part of the tendril in contact with the object\ndoes not grow as rapidly as the part of the tendril away from the object.\nThis causes the tendril to circle around the object and thus cling to it.\nMore commonly, plants respond to stimuli slowly by growing in a\nparticular direction. Because this growth is directional, it appears as if\nthe plant is moving. Let us understand this type of movement with the\nhelp of an example.\n2024-25\n\nControl and Coordination 107Environmental triggers such as light, or gravity\nwill change the directions that plant parts grow in.\nThese directional, or tropic, movements can be either\ntowards the stimulus, or away from it. So, in two\ndifferent kinds of phototropic movement, shoots\nrespond by bending towards light while roots\nrespond by bending away from it. How does this help\nthe plant?\nPlants show tropism in response to other stimuli as well. The roots\nof a plant always grow downwards while the shoots usually grow\nupwards and away from the earth. This upward and downward growth\nof shoots and roots, respectively, in response to the pull of earth or gravity\nis, obviously, geotropism (Fig. 6.6). If \u2018hydro\u2019 means water and \u2018chemo\u2019\nrefers to chemicals, what would \u2018hydrotropism\u2019 and \u2018chemotropism\u2019\nmean? Can we think of examples of these kinds of directional growth\nmovements? One example of chemotropism is the growth of pollen tubes\ntowards ovules, about which we will learn more when we examine the\nreproductive processes of living organisms.\nLet us now once again think about how information is communicated\nin the bodies of multicellular organisms. The movement of the\nsensitive plant in response to touch is very quick. The movement of\nsunflowers in response to day or night, on the other hand, is quite slow.\nGrowth-r elated movement of plants will be even slower .\nEven in animal bodies, there are carefully controlled directions to\ngrowth. Our arms and fingers grow in certain directions, not haphazardly.\nSo controlled movements can be either slow or fast. If fast responses to\nstimuli are to be made, information transfer must happen very quickly.\nFor this, the medium of transmission must be able to move rapidly.Activity 6.2Activity 6.2Activity 6.2Activity 6.2Activity 6.2\n/square6Fill a conical flask with water .\n/square6Cover the neck of the flask with a wire mesh.\n/square6Keep two or three freshly germinated bean\nseeds on the wire mesh.\n/square6Take a cardboard box which is open from one\nside.\n/square6Keep the flask in the box in such a manner\nthat the open side of the box faces light coming\nfrom a window (Fig. 6.5).\n/square6After two or three days, you will notice that\nthe shoots bend towards light and roots away\nfrom light.\n/square6Now turn the flask so that the shoots are away\nfrom light and the roots towards light. Leave it\nundisturbed in this condition for a few days.\n/square6Have the old parts of the shoot and root\nchanged direction?\n/square6Are there differences in the direction of the new\ngrowth?\n/square6What can we conclude from this activity?\nFigure 6.5Figure 6.5Figure 6.5Figure 6.5Figure 6.5\nResponse of the plant to the direction of light\nFigure 6.6 Figure 6.6 Figure 6.6 Figure 6.6 Figure 6.6 Plant showing geotropism\n2024-25\n\nScience 108Electrical impulses are an excellent means for this. But there are\nlimitations to the use of electrical impulses. Firstly, they will reach only\nthose cells that are connected by nervous tissue, not each and every cell\nin the animal body. Secondly, once an electrical impulse is generated in\na cell and transmitted, the cell will take some time to reset its mechanisms\nbefore it can generate and transmit a new impulse. In other words, cells\ncannot continually create and transmit electrical impulses. It is thus no\nwonder that most multicellular organisms use another means of\ncommunication between cells, namely, chemical communication.\nIf, instead of generating an electrical impulse, stimulated cells release\na chemical compound, this compound would diffuse all around the\noriginal cell. If other cells around have the means to detect this compound\nusing special molecules on their surfaces, then they would be able to\nrecognise infor mation, and even transmit it. This will be slower , of course,\nbut it can potentially reach all cells of the body, regardless of nervous\nconnections, and it can be done steadily and persistently. These\ncompounds, or hormones used by multicellular organisms for control\nand coordination show a great deal of diversity, as we would expect.\nDifferent plant hormones help to coordinate growth, development and\nresponses to the environment. They are synthesised at places away from\nwhere they act and simply diffuse to the area of action.\nLet us take an example that we have worked with earlier [Activity 6.2].\nWhen growing plants detect light, a hormone called auxin, synthesised\nat the shoot tip, helps the cells to gr ow longer . When light is coming fr om\none side of the plant, auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot.\nThis concentration of auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the\nside of the shoot which is away from light. Thus, the plant appears to\nbend towards light.\nAnother example of plant hormones are gibberellins which, like\nauxins, help in the growth of the stem. Cytokinins promote cell division,\nand it is natural then that they are present in greater concentration in\nareas of rapid cell division, such as in fruits and seeds. These are examples\nof plant hormones that help in promoting growth. But plants also need\nsignals to stop growing. Abscisic acid is one example of a hormone which\ninhibits growth. Its effects include wilting of leaves.\nQUESTIONS\n?1. What are plant hormones?\n2. How is the movement of leaves of the sensitive plant different from the\nmovement of a shoot towards light?\n3. Give an example of a plant hormone that promotes growth.\n4. How do auxins promote the growth of a tendril around a support?\n5. Design an experiment to demonstrate hydrotropism.\n2024-25\n\nControl and Coordination 1096.3 HORMONES IN ANIMALS6.3 HORMONES IN ANIMALS6.3 HORMONES IN ANIMALS6.3 HORMONES IN ANIMALS6.3 HORMONES IN ANIMALS\nHow are such chemical, or hormonal, means of information transmission\nused in animals? What do some animals, for instance squirrels,\nexperience when they are in a scary situation? Their bodies have to\nprepare for either fighting or running away. Both are very complicated\nactivities that will use a great deal of energy in controlled ways. Many\ndifferent tissue types will be used and their activities integrated together\nin these actions. However , the two alter nate activities, fighting or running,\nare also quite different! So here is a situation in which some common\npreparations can be usefully made in the body. These preparations\nshould ideally make it easier to do either activity in the near future. How\nwould this be achieved?\nIf the body design in the squirrel relied only on electrical impulses\nvia nerve cells, the range of tissues instructed to prepare for the coming\nactivity would be limited. On the other hand, if a chemical signal were to\nbe sent as well, it would reach all cells of the body and provide the wide-\nranging changes needed. This is done in many animals, including human\nbeings, using a hormone called adrenaline that is secreted from the\nadrenal glands. Look at Fig. 6.7 to locate these glands.\nAdrenaline is secreted directly into the blood and carried to different\nparts of the body. The target organs or the specific tissues on which it\nacts include the heart. As a r esult, the heart beats faster , resulting in\nsupply of more oxygen to our muscles. The blood to the digestive system\nand skin is reduced due to contraction of muscles around small arteries\nin these organs. This diverts the blood to our skeletal muscles. The\nbreathing rate also increases because of the contractions of the\ndiaphragm and the rib muscles. All these responses together enable the\nanimal body to be ready to deal with the situation. Such animal hormones\nare part of the endocrine system which constitutes a second way of control\nand coordination in our body.\nActivity 6.3Activity 6.3Activity 6.3Activity 6.3Activity 6.3\n/square6Look at Fig. 6.7.\n/square6Identify the endocrine glands mentioned in the figure.\n/square6Some of these glands have been listed in Table 6.1 and discussed\nin the text. Consult books in the library and discuss with your\nteachers to find out about other glands.\nRemember that plants have hormones that control their directional\ngrowth. What functions do animal hormones perform? On the face of it,\nwe cannot imagine their r ole in dir ectional gr owth. W e have never seen\nan animal gr owing mor e in one dir ection or the other , depending on\nlight or gravity! But if we think about it a bit more, it will become evident\nthat, even in animal bodies, growth happens in carefully controlled places.\nPlants will grow leaves in many places on the plant body, for example.\nBut we do not grow fingers on our faces. The design of the body is carefully\nmaintained even during the growth of children.\n2024-25\n\nScience 110Let us examine some examples to understand how hormones help\nin coordinated growth. We have all seen salt packets which say \u2018iodised\nsalt\u2019 or \u2018enriched with iodine\u2019. Why is it important for us to have iodised\nsalt in our diet? Iodine is necessary for the thyroid gland to make\nthyroxin hormone. Thyroxin regulates carbohydrate, protein and fat\nmetabolism in the body so as to provide the best balance for growth.\nIodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroxin. In case iodine is deficient\nin our diet, there is a possibility that we might suffer from goitre. One\nof the symptoms in this disease is a swollen neck. Can you correlate\nthis with the position of the thyroid gland in Fig. 6.7?\nSometimes we come across people who are either very short (dwarfs)\nor extremely tall (giants). Have you ever wondered how this happens?\nGrowth hormone is one of the hormones secreted by the pituitary. As\nits name indicates, growth hormone regulates growth and development\nof the body. If there is a deficiency of this hormone in childhood, it\nleads to dwarfism.\nYou must have noticed many dramatic changes in your appearance\nas well as that of your friends as you approached 10\u201312 years of age.\nThese changes associated with puberty are because of the secretion of\ntestosterone in males and oestrogen in females.\nDo you know anyone in your family or friends who has been advised\nby the doctor to take less sugar in their diet because they are suffering\nfrom diabetes? As a treatment, they might be taking injections of insulin.\nThis is a hormone which is produced by the pancreas and helps in\nregulating blood sugar levels. If it is not secreted in proper amounts,\nthe sugar level in the blood rises causing many harmful effects.Figure 6.7 Endocrine glands in human beings (a) male, (b) female(a) (b)\nDo You Know?\nHypothalamus plays\nan important role in\nthe release of many\nhormones. For\nexample, when the\nlevel of growth\nhormone is low, the\nhypothalamus\nreleases growth\nhormone releasing\nfactor which\nstimulates the\npituitary gland to\nrelease growth\nhormone.\n2024-25\n\nControl and Coordination 111If it is so important that hormones should be secreted in precise\nquantities, we need a mechanism through which this is done. The timing\nand amount of hormone released are regulated by feedback mechanisms.\nFor example, if the sugar levels in blood rise, they are detected by the\ncells of the pancreas which respond by producing more insulin. As the\nblood sugar level falls, insulin secretion is reduced.\nTable 6.1 : Some important hormones and their functionsActivity 6.4Activity 6.4Activity 6.4Activity 6.4Activity 6.4\n/square6  Hormones are secreted by endocrine glands and have specific functions.

On lighting up the room,\nthings become visible. What makes things visible? During the day, the\nsunlight helps us to see objects. An object reflects light that falls on it.\nThis reflected light, when received by our eyes, enables us to see things.\nWe are able to see thr ough a transpar ent medium as light is transmitted\nthrough it. There are a number of common wonderful phenomena\nassociated with light such as image formation by mirrors, the twinkling\nof stars, the beautiful colours of a rainbow, bending of light by a medium\nand so on.  A study of the properties of light helps us to explore them.\nBy observing the common optical phenomena around us, we may\nconclude that light seems to travel in straight lines. The fact that a small\nsource of light casts a sharp  shadow of an opaque object points to this\nstraight-line path of light, usually indicated as a ray of light.More to Know!If an opaque object on the path of light becomes very small , light has a tendency to\nbend around it and not walk in a straight line \u2013 an effect known as the diffraction of\nlight. Then the straight-line treatment of optics using rays fails. To explain phenomena\nsuch as diffraction, light is thought of as a wave, the details of which you will study\nin higher classes. Again, at the beginning of the 20th century, it became known that\nthe wave theory of light often becomes inadequate for treatment of the interaction of\nlight with matter , and light often behaves somewhat like a str eam of  particles . This\nconfusion about the true nature of light continued for some years till a modern\nquantum theory of light emerged in which light is neither a \u2018wave\u2019 nor a \u2018particle\u2019 \u2013\nthe new theory reconciles the particle properties of light with the wave nature.\nIn this Chapter , we shall study the phenomena of r eflection and\nrefraction of light using the straight-line propagation of light. These basic\nconcepts will help us in the study of some of the optical phenomena in\nnatur e. We shall try to understand in this Chapter the r eflection of light\nby spherical mirrors and refraction of light and their application in real\nlife situations.\n9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT\nA highly polished sur face, such as a mirr or, reflects most of the light\nfalling on it. Y ou ar e already familiar with the laws of r eflection of light.\n2024-25\n\nLight \u2013 Reflection and Refraction 135Let us recall these laws \u2013\n(i)The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, and\n(ii)The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence\nand the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane.\nThese laws of reflection are applicable to all types of reflecting surfaces\nincluding spherical sur faces. Y ou are familiar with the for mation of image\nby a plane mirr or. What ar e the pr operties of the image? Image for med\nby a plane mirror is always virtual and erect.  The size of the image is\nequal to that of the object.  The image formed is as far behind the mirror\nas the object is in fr ont of it.  Further , the image is laterally inverted.\nHow would the images be when the reflecting surfaces are curved? Let\nus explore.\nActivity 9.1Activity 9.1Activity 9.1Activity 9.1Activity 9.1\n/square6Take a large shining spoon. Try to view your face in its curved\nsurface.\n/square6Do you get the image?  Is it smaller or larger?\n/square6Move the spoon slowly away from your face. Observe the image.\nHow does it change?\n/square6Reverse the spoon and repeat the Activity.  How does the image\nlook like now?\n/square6Compare the characteristics of the image on the two surfaces.\nThe curved surface of a shining spoon could be considered as a curved\nmirror.  The most commonly used type of curved mirr or is the spherical\nmirror.  The r eflecting sur face of such mirr ors can be consider ed to for m\na part of the surface of a sphere.  Such mirrors, whose reflecting surfaces\nare spherical, ar e called spherical mirr ors.  W e shall now study about\nspherical mirrors in some detail.\n9.2 SPHERIC9.2 SPHERIC9.2 SPHERIC9.2 SPHERIC9.2 SPHERIC AL MIRRORSAL MIRRORSAL MIRRORSAL MIRRORSAL MIRRORS\nThe reflecting surface of a spherical mirror may be curved inwards or\noutwar ds.  A spherical mirr or, whose r eflecting sur face is curved inwar ds,\nthat is, faces towar ds the centr e of the spher e, is called a concave mirr or.\nA spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved outwards, is called\na convex mirr or. The schematic r epresentation of these mirr ors is shown\nin Fig. 9.1. Y ou may note in these diagrams that the back\nof the mirror is shaded.\nYou may now understand that the sur face of the spoon\ncurved inwards can be approximated to a concave mirror\nand the surface of the spoon bulged outwards can be\napproximated to a convex mirr or.\nBefore we move further on spherical mirrors, we need to\nrecognise and understand the meaning of a few terms. These\nterms are commonly used in discussions about spherical\nmirrors. The centre of the reflecting surface of a spherical\nmirror is a point called the pole.  It lies on the surface of the\nmirror.  The pole is usually r epresented by the letter P .Figure 9.1Figure 9.1Figure 9.1Figure 9.1Figure 9.1\nSchematic representation of spherical\nmirrors; the shaded side is non-reflecting.(a) Concave mirror (b) Convex mirror\n2024-25\n\nScience 136The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part of a sphere.\nThis sphere has a centre. This point is called the centre of curvature of\nthe spherical mirr or. It is r epresented by the letter C. Please note that the\ncentr e of curvatur e is not a part of the mirr or. It lies outside its r eflecting\nsurface. The centre of curvature of a concave mirror lies in front of it.\nHowever , it lies behind the mirr or in case of a convex mirr or. You may\nnote this in Fig.9.2 (a) and (b). The radius of the sphere of which the\nreflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part, is called the radius\nof curvatur e of the mirr or. It is r epresented by the letter R. You may note\nthat the distance PC is equal to the radius of curvature. Imagine a straight\nline passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical\nmirror. This line is called the principal axis. Remember that principal\naxis is normal to the mirror at its pole. Let us understand an important\nterm related to mirrors, through an Activity.\nActivity 9.2Activity 9.2Activity 9.2Activity 9.2Activity 9.2\nCAUTION : Do not look at the Sun directly or even into a mirror\nreflecting sunlight. It may damage your eyes.\n/square6Hold a concave mirror in your hand and direct its reflecting surface\ntowards the Sun.\n/square6Direct the light reflected by the mirror on to a sheet of paper held\nclose to the mirr or.\n/square6Move the sheet of paper back and forth gradually until you find\non the paper sheet a bright, sharp spot of light.\n/square6Hold the mirror and the paper in the same position for a few\nminutes. What do you observe? Why?\nThe paper at first begins to burn producing smoke. Eventually it\nmay even catch fire. Why does it burn? The light from the Sun is converged\nat a point, as a sharp, bright spot by the mirr or. In fact, this spot of light\nis the image of the Sun on the sheet of paper . This point is\nthe focus of the concave mirr or. The heat pr oduced due to\nthe concentration of sunlight ignites the paper . The distance\nof this image from the position of the mirror gives the\napproximate value of focal length of the mirr or.\nLet us try to understand this observation with the help\nof a ray diagram.\nObserve Fig.9.2 (a) closely. A number of rays parallel\nto the principal axis are falling on a concave mirr or. Observe\nthe reflected rays. They are all meeting/intersecting at a\npoint on the principal axis of the mirr or.  This point is called\nthe principal focus of the concave mirr or. Similarly, observe\nFig. 9.2 (b). How are the rays parallel to the principal axis,\nreflected by a convex mirror? The reflected rays appear to\ncome from a point on the principal axis. This point is called\nthe principal focus of the convex mirr or. The principal focus\nis represented by the letter F . The distance between the\npole and the principal focus of a spherical mirror is called\nthe focal length. It is represented by the letter f.Figure 9.2Figure 9.2Figure 9.2Figure 9.2Figure 9.2\n(a) Concave mirror\n(b)     Convex mirror(b)(a)\n2024-25\n\nLight \u2013 Reflection and Refraction 137The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is by-and-large spherical.\nThe surface, then, has a circular outline. The diameter of the reflecting\nsurface of spherical mirror is called its aperture. In Fig.9.2, distance MN\nrepresents the apertur e. We shall consider in our discussion only such\nspherical mirrors whose aperture is much smaller than its radius of\ncurvature.\nIs there a relationship between the radius of curvature R,  and focal\nlength f, of a spherical mirror? For spherical mirrors of small apertures,\nthe radius of curvatur e is found to be equal to twice the focal length. W e\nput this as R = 2f  .  This implies that the principal focus of a spherical\nmirror lies midway between the pole and centre of curvature.\n9.2.1  Image F ormation by Spherical Mir rors\nYou have studied about the image for mation by plane mirr ors. Y ou also\nknow the nature, position and relative size of the images formed by them.\nHow about the images formed by spherical mirrors? How can we locate\nthe image formed by a concave mirror for different positions of the object?\nAre the images real or virtual? Are they enlarged, diminished or have\nthe same size? W e shall explor e this with an Activity.\nActivity 9.3Activity 9.3Activity 9.3Activity 9.3Activity 9.3\nYou have alr eady lear nt a way of deter mining the focal length of a\nconcave mirr or. In Activity 9.2, you have seen that the sharp bright\nspot of light you got on the paper is, in fact, the image of the Sun. It\nwas a tiny, r eal, inverted image. Y ou got the appr oximate focal length\nof the concave mirror by measuring the distance of the image from\nthe mirr or.\n/square6Take a concave mirr or.  Find out its appr oximate focal length in\nthe way described above. Note down the value of focal length. (Y ou\ncan also find it out by obtaining image of a distant object on a\nsheet of paper .)\n/square6Mark a line on a Table with a chalk.  Place the concave mirror on\na stand.  Place the stand over the line such that its pole lies over\nthe line.\n/square6Draw with a chalk two more lines parallel to the previous line\nsuch that the distance between any two successive lines is equal\nto the focal length of the mirr or. These lines will now corr espond\nto the positions of the points P , F and C, r espectively. Remember  \u2013\nFor a spherical mirror of small aperture, the principal focus F lies\nmid-way between the pole P and the centre of curvature C.\n/square6Keep a bright object, say a burning candle, at a position far beyond\nC.  Place a paper screen and move it in front of the mirror till you\nobtain a sharp bright image of the candle flame on it.\n/square6Observe the image carefully.  Note down its nature, position and\nrelative size with respect to the object size.\n/square6Repeat the activity by placing the candle  \u2013 (a) just beyond C,\n(b) at C, (c) between F and C, (d) at F , and (e) between P and F .\n/square6In one of the cases, you may not get the image on the screen.\nIdentify the position of the object in such a case. Then, look for its\nvirtual image in the mirror itself.\n/square6Note down and tabulate your observations.\n2024-25\n\nScience 138You will see in the above Activity that the natur e, position and size of\nthe image formed by a concave mirror depends on the position of the\nobject in r elation to points P , F and C. The image for med is r eal for some\npositions of the object. It is found to be a virtual image for a certain other\nposition. The image is either magnified, reduced or has the same size,\ndepending on the position of the object. A summary of these observations\nis given for your reference in Table 9.1.\nTable 9.1  Image formation by a concave mirror for different positions of the object\nPosition of the Position of the Size of the Nature of the\nobject image image image\nAt infinity At the focus F Highly diminished, Real and inverted\npoint-sized\nBeyond C Between F and C Diminished Real and inverted\nAt C At C Same size Real and inverted\nBetween C and F Beyond C Enlarged Real and inverted\nAt F At infinity Highly enlarged Real and inverted\nBetween P and F Behind the mirror Enlarged Virtual and erect\n9.2.2 Representation of Images F ormed by Spherical\nMirrors Using Ray Diagrams\nWe can also study the for mation of images by spherical mirrors by\ndrawing ray diagrams. Consider an extended object, of finite size, placed\nin front of a spherical mirr or. Each small portion of the extended object\nacts like a point source. An infinite number of rays originate from each\nof these points. To construct the ray diagrams, in order to locate the\nimage of an object, an arbitrarily large number of rays emanating from a\npoint could be consider ed.  However , it is mor e convenient to consider\nonly two rays, for the sake of clarity of the ray diagram. These rays are\nso chosen that it is easy to know their directions after reflection from the\nmirror.\nThe intersection of at least two reflected rays give the position of image\nof the point object.  Any two of the following rays can be considered for\nlocating the image.\n(i)A ray parallel to the principal\naxis, after reflection, will pass\nthrough the principal focus\nin case of a concave mirror\nor appear to diverge from\nthe principal focus in\ncase of a convex mirr or.\nThis is illustrated in Fig.9.3\n(a) and (b).(a) (b)\nFigure FigureFigureFigureFigure  9.3\n9.39.3 9.39.3\n2024-25\n\nLight \u2013 Reflection and Refraction 139(ii)A ray passing through the\nprincipal focus  of a concave\nmirror or  a ray which is\ndirected towards the\nprincipal focus of a convex\nmirror, after reflection, will\nemerge parallel to the\nprincipal axis. This is\nillustrated in Fig.9.4 (a)\nand (b).\n(iii) A ray passing through the\ncentre of curvature  of a\nconcave mirror or directed\nin the direction of the centre\nof curvature of a convex\nmirror, after r eflection, is\nreflected back along the\nsame path.  This is\nillustrated in Fig.9.5 (a) and\n(b). The light rays come back\nalong the same path\nbecause the incident rays\nfall on the mirror along the\nnormal to the reflecting\nsurface.\n(iv)A ray incident obliquely to\nthe principal axis , towards\na point P (pole of the mirror),\non the concave mirror\n[Fig. 9.6 (a)] or a convex\nmirror [Fig. 9.6 (b)], is\nreflected obliquely. The\nincident and reflected rays\nfollow the laws of reflection\nat the point of incidence\n(point P), making equal\nangles with the principal axis.(a) (b)\nFigure 9.4Figure 9.4Figure 9.4Figure 9.4Figure 9.4\nRemember that in all the above cases the laws of reflection are followed.\nAt the point of incidence, the incident ray is reflected in such a way that\nthe angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence.\n(a)Image formation by Concave Mirror\nFigure 9.7 illustrates the ray diagrams for the formation of image\nby a concave mirror for various positions of the object.(b) (a)\nFigure 9.5Figure 9.5Figure 9.5Figure 9.5Figure 9.5\n(a) (b)\nFigure 9.6Figure 9.6Figure 9.6Figure 9.6Figure 9.6\n2024-25\n\nScience 140Figure 9.7Figure 9.7Figure 9.7Figure 9.7Figure 9.7  Ray diagrams for the image formation by a concave mirror\nActivity 9.4Activity 9.4Activity 9.4Activity 9.4Activity 9.4\n/square6Draw neat ray diagrams for each position of the object shown in\nTable 9.1.\n/square6You may take any two of the rays mentioned in the pr evious section\nfor locating the image.\n/square6Compare your diagram with those given in Fig. 9.7.\n/square6Describe the nature, position and relative size of the image formed\nin each case.\n/square6Tabulate the results in a convenient format.\nUses of concave mirrors\nConcave mirrors are commonly used in torches, search-lights and\nvehicles headlights to get powerful parallel beams of light. They are\noften used as shaving mirrors to see a larger image of the face. The\ndentists use concave mirrors to see large images of the teeth of patients.\nLarge concave mirrors are used to concentrate sunlight to produce\nheat in solar furnaces.\n(b)Image formation by a Convex Mirror\nWe studied the image for mation by a concave mirr or. Now we shall\nstudy the for mation of image by a convex mirr or.\n2024-25\n\nLight \u2013 Reflection and Refraction 141We consider two positions of the object for studying the image for med\nby a convex mirr or.  First is when the object is at infinity and the second\nposition is when the object is at a finite distance fr om the mirr or. The ray\ndiagrams for the formation of image by a convex mirror for these two\npositions of the object are shown in Fig.9.8 (a) and (b), respectively.  The\nresults are summarised in Table 9.2.Activity 9.5Activity 9.5Activity 9.5Activity 9.5Activity 9.5\n/square6Take a convex mirr or.  Hold it in one hand.\n/square6Hold a pencil in the upright position in the other hand.\n/square6Observe the image of the pencil in the mirr or. Is the image er ect or\ninverted?  Is it diminished or enlarged?\n/square6Move the pencil away from the mirror slowly. Does the image\nbecome smaller or larger?\n/square6Repeat this Activity carefully.  State whether the image will move\ncloser to or farther away from the focus as the object is moved\naway from the mirror?\nFigure 9.8 Figure 9.8 Figure 9.8 Figure 9.8 Figure 9.8 Formation of image by a convex mirror\nYou have so far studied the image for mation by a plane mirr or, a\nconcave mirr or and a convex mirr or.  Which of these mirr ors will give the\nfull image of a large object? Let us explore through an Activity.\nActivity 9.6Activity 9.6Activity 9.6Activity 9.6Activity 9.6\n/square6Observe the image of a distant object, say a distant tree, in a\nplane mirr or.\n/square6Could you see a full-length image?Table 9.2  Nature, position and relative size of the image formed by a convex mirror\nPosition of the Position of the Size of the Nature of the\nobject image image image\nAt infinity At the focus F , Highly diminished, Virtual and erect\nbehind the mirror point-sized\nBetween infinity Between P and F , Diminished Virtual and erect\nand the pole P of behind the mirror\nthe mirror\n2024-25\n\nScience 142/square6Try with plane mirrors of different sizes. Did you see the entire\nobject in the image?\n/square6Repeat this Activity with a concave mirr or.  Did the mirr or show\nfull length image of the object?\n/square6Now try using a convex mirr or. Did you succeed? Explain your\nobservations with reason.\nYou can see a full-length image of a tall building/tr ee in a small\nconvex mirr or. One such mirr or is fitted in a wall of Agra Fort facing T aj\nMahal. If you visit the Agra Fort, try to observe the full image of Taj\nMahal. To view distinctly, you should stand suitably at the terrace\nadjoining the wall.\nUses of convex mirrors\nConvex mirr ors ar e commonly used as r ear-view (wing) mirr ors in\nvehicles. These mirrors are fitted on the sides of the vehicle, enabling the\ndriver to see traffic behind him/her to facilitate safe driving. Convex\nmirrors are preferred because they always give an erect, though\ndiminished, image. Also, they have a wider field of view as they are curved\noutwards. Thus, convex mirrors enable the driver to view much larger\narea than would be possible with a plane mirr or.\nQUESTIONS\n?1. Define the principal focus of a concave mirr or.\n2. The radius of curvature of a spherical mirror is 20 cm.  What is its focal\nlength?\n3. Name a mirror that can give an erect and enlarged image of an object.\n4. Why do we pr efer a convex mirr or as a r ear-view mirr or in vehicles?\n9.2.3 Sign Convention for Reflection by Spherical Mirrors\nWhile dealing with the reflection of light by spherical mirrors, we shall\nfollow a set of sign conventions called the New Cartesian Sign\nConvention . In this convention, the pole (P) of the mirror is taken as the\norigin (Fig. 9.9).  The principal axis of the mirror is taken as the x-axis\n(X\u2019X) of the coordinate system. The conventions are as follows \u2013\n(i)The object is always placed to the left of the mirr or. This implies\nthat the light from the object falls on the mirror from the left-hand\nside.\n(ii)All distances parallel to the principal axis are measured from the\npole of the mirr or.\n(iii) All the distances measured to the right of the origin (along\n+ x-axis) are taken as positive while those measured to the left of\nthe origin (along \u2013 x-axis) are taken as negative.\n(iv) Distances measured perpendicular to and above the principal axis\n(along + y-axis) are taken as positive.\n(v)Distances measured perpendicular to and below the principal axis\n(along \u2013y-axis) are taken as negative.\n2024-25\n\nLight \u2013 Reflection and Refraction 143The New Cartesian Sign Convention described above is illustrated in\nFig.9.9 for your reference. These sign conventions are applied to obtain\nthe mirror formula and solve related numerical problems.\n9.2.4  Mir ror Formula and  Magnification\nIn a spherical mirror , the distance of the\nobject from its pole is called the object\ndistance ( u).  The distance of the image from\nthe pole of the mirror is called the image\ndistance ( v). You alr eady know that the\ndistance of the principal focus from the pole\nis called the focal length ( f). There is a\nrelationship between these three quantities\ngiven by the mirr or for mula which is\nexpressed as\n1 1 1\nv u f+ = (9.1)\nThis formula is valid in all situations for all\nspherical mirrors for all positions of the\nobject. Y ou must use the New Cartesian Sign\nConvention while substituting numerical\nvalues for u, v, f , and R in the mirror formula\nfor solving problems.\nMagnification\nMagnification produced by a spherical mirror gives the relative extent to\nwhich the image of an object is magnified with respect to the object size.\nIt is expressed as the ratio of the height of the image to the height of the\nobject. It is usually represented by the letter m.\nIf h is the height of the object and h \u2032 is the height of the image, then\nthe magnification m  produced by a spherical mirror is given by\nm = Height of the image ( )\nHeight of the object ( )\u2032h\nh\nm = \u2032h\nh(9.2)\nThe magnification m  is also related to the object distance ( u) and\nimage distance ( v).  It can be expressed as:\nMagnification ( m)  = \u2032= \u2212h\nhv\nu(9.3)\nYou may note that the height of the object is taken to be positive as\nthe object is usually placed above the principal axis.  The height of the\nimage should be taken as positive for virtual images.  However , it is to be\ntaken as negative for real images. A negative sign in the value of the\nmagnification indicates that the image is real. A positive sign in the value\nof the magnification indicates that the image is virtual.Figure 9.9Figure 9.9Figure 9.9Figure 9.9Figure 9.9\nThe New Cartesian Sign Convention for spherical mirrors\n2024-25\n\nScience 144Example 9.1\nA convex mirr or used for r ear-view on an automobile has a radius of\ncurvatur e of 3.00 m.

Does it still move along a straight-line path or change its\ndirection? W e shall r ecall some of our day-to-day experiences.\nYou might have observed that the bottom of a tank or a pond\ncontaining water appears to be raised. Similarly, when a thick glass slab\nis placed over some printed matter , the letters appear raised when viewed\nthrough the glass slab. Why does it happen? Have you seen a pencil\npartly immersed in water in a glass tumbler? It appears to be displaced\nat the inter face of air and water . You might have observed that a lemon\nkept in water in a glass tumbler appears to be bigger than its actual\nsize, when viewed from the sides. How can you account for such\nexperiences?\nLet us consider the case of the apparent displacement of a pencil,\npartly immersed in water . The light r eaching you fr om the portion of the\npencil inside water seems to come from a different direction, compared\nto the part above water . This makes the pencil appear to be displaced at\nthe interface. For similar reasons, the letters appear to be raised, when\nseen through a glass slab placed over it.\nDoes a pencil appear to be displaced to the same extent, if instead of\nwater , we use liquids like kerosene or turpentine? W ill the letters appear\nto rise to the same height if we replace a glass slab with a transparent\nplastic slab? Y ou will find that the extent of the ef fect is dif ferent for\ndifferent pair of media. These observations indicate that light does not\n2024-25\n\nScience 146travel in the same direction in all media. It appears that when travelling\nobliquely from one medium to another , the dir ection of pr opagation of\nlight in the second medium changes. This phenomenon is known as\nrefraction of light. Let us understand this phenomenon further by doing\na few activities .\nActivity 9.7Activity 9.7Activity 9.7Activity 9.7Activity 9.7\n/square6Place a coin at the bottom of a bucket filled with water .\n/square6With your eye to a side above water , try to pick up the coin in one\ngo.

The\ncoin appears slightly raised above its actual position due to refraction of\nlight.\nActivity 9.9Activity 9.9Activity 9.9Activity 9.9Activity 9.9\n/square6Draw a thick straight line in ink, over a sheet of white paper placed\non a Table.\n/square6Place a glass slab over the line in such a way that one of its edges\nmakes an angle with the line.\n/square6Look at the portion of the line under the slab from the sides.

Does the part of the line under the glass slab\nappear bent?\n/square6Look at the line from the top of the glass slab. Does the part of the\nline, beneath the slab, appear to be raised? Why does this happen?\n9.3.1 Refraction through a Rectangular Glass Slab\nTo understand the phenomenon of refraction of light through a glass\nslab, let us do an Activity.\n2024-25\n\nLight \u2013 Reflection and Refraction 147In this Activity, you will note, the light ray has changed its direction\nat points O and O \u2032. Note that both the points O and O \u2032 lie on surfaces\nseparating two transparent media. Draw a perpendicular NN\u2019 to AB at O\nand another perpendicular MM \u2032 to CD at O \u2032. The light ray at point O has\nentered from a rarer medium to a denser medium, that is, from air to\nglass. Note that the light ray has bent towards\nthe normal. At O \u2032, the light ray has entered\nfrom glass to air , that is, fr om a denser\nmedium to a rarer medium.  The light here\nhas bent away from the normal. Compare the\nangle of incidence with the angle of refraction\nat both refracting surfaces AB and CD.\nIn Fig. 9.10, a ray EO is obliquely\nincident on surface AB, called incident ray.\nOO\u2032 is the refracted ray and O\u2032 H is the\nemer gent ray. Y ou may observe that the\nemergent ray is parallel to the direction of\nthe incident ray. Why does it happen so? The\nextent of bending of the ray of light at the\nopposite parallel faces AB (air -glass inter face)\nand CD (glass-air interface) of the rectangular\nglass slab is equal and opposite. This is why\nthe ray emerges parallel to the incident ray.\nHowever , the light ray is shifted sidewar d\nslightly. What happens when a light ray is\nincident normally to the interface of two\nmedia? T ry and find out.\nNow you are familiar with the refraction of light. Refraction is due to\nchange in the speed of light as it enters from one transparent medium to\nanother .  Experiments show that r efraction of light occurs accor ding to\ncertain laws.Activity 9.10Activity 9.10Activity 9.10Activity 9.10Activity 9.10\n/square6Fix a sheet of white paper on a drawing board using drawing pins.\n/square6Place a rectangular glass slab over the sheet in the middle.\n/square6Draw the outline of the slab with a pencil.

Also produce EF up to P , as shown by a dotted line\nin Fig. 9.10.\nFigure 9.10Figure 9.10Figure 9.10Figure 9.10Figure 9.10\nRefraction of light through a rectangular glass slab\n2024-25\n\nScience 148The following are the laws of refraction of light.\n (i)The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the interface\nof two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the\nsame plane.\n(ii)The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of\nrefraction is a constant, for the light of a given colour and for\nthe given pair of media.  This law is also known as Snell\u2019s law of\nrefraction. (This is true for angle 0 < i  < 90o)\nIf i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of refraction, then,\nsin\nsini\nr = constant (9.4)\nThis constant value is called the refractive index of the second medium\nwith respect to the first.  Let us study about refractive index in some detail.\n9.3.2 The Refractive Index\nYou have alr eady studied that a ray of light that travels obliquely fr om\none transparent medium into another will change its direction in the\nsecond medium. The extent of the change in direction that takes place\nin a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index,\nthe \u201cconstant\u201d appearing on the right-hand side of Eq.(9.4).\nThe refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity,\nthe relative speed of propagation of light in different media. It turns\nout that light propagates with different speeds in different media. Light\ntravels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3\u00d7108 m s\u20131.  In air , the speed of\nlight is only marginally less, compared to that in vacuum. It reduces\nconsiderably in glass or water . The value of the r efractive index for a\ngiven pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media, as\ngiven below.\nConsider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2, as\nshown in Fig.9.11.  Let v1 be the speed of light in medium 1 and v2 be the\nspeed of light in medium 2.  The refractive index of medium 2 with respect\nto medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and\nthe speed of light in medium 2. This is usually represented by the symbol\nn21. This can be expressed in an equation form as\nn21=Speed of light in medium 1 \nSpeed of light in medium 2=v\nv1\n2(9.5)\nBy the same argument, the refractive index of medium\n1 with respect to medium 2 is represented as n12. It is given\nby\nn12=Speed of light in medium 2 \nSpeed of light in medium 1=v\nv2\n1(9.6)\nIf medium 1 is vacuum or air , then the r efractive index of medium 2\nis considered with respect to vacuum.  This is called the absolute refractive\nindex of the medium.  It is simply represented as n2. If c is the speed ofFigure 9.11Figure 9.11Figure 9.11Figure 9.11Figure 9.11\n2024-25\n\nLight \u2013 Reflection and Refraction 149The ability of a medium to refract light is also expressed in terms of its optical density.\nOptical density has a definite connotation.  It is not the same as mass density. W e have\nbeen using the ter ms \u2018rar er medium\u2019 and \u2018denser medium\u2019 in this Chapter . It actually\nmeans  \u2018optically rarer medium\u2019 and \u2018optically denser medium\u2019, respectively. When can\nwe say that a medium is optically denser than the other? In comparing two media, the\none with the lar ger refractive index is optically denser medium than the other .  The other\nmedium of lower refractive index is optically rar er.  The speed of light is higher in a rar er\nmedium than a denser medium. Thus, a ray of light travelling from a rarer medium to a\ndenser medium slows down and bends  towards the normal. When it travels from a\ndenser medium to a rarer medium, it speeds up and bends away from the normal.Note from Table 9.3 that an optically denser medium may not possess\ngreater mass density. For example, kerosene having higher refractive\nindex, is optically denser than water , although its mass density is less\nthan water .Material Refractive Material Refractive\nmedium index medium index\nAir 1.0003 Canada 1.53\nBalsam\nIce 1.31\nWater 1.33 Rock salt 1.54\nAlcohol 1.36\nKerosene 1.44 Carbon 1.63\ndisulphide\nFused 1.46\nquartz Dense 1.65\nflint glass\nTurpentine 1.47\noil Ruby 1.71\nBenzene 1.50\nSapphire 1.77\nCrown 1.52\nglass Diamond  2.42light in air and v is the speed of light in the medium, then, the refractive\nindex of the medium nm is given by\nnm = Speed of light in air \nSpeed of light in the medium =c\nv(9.7)\nThe absolute refractive index of a medium is simply called its refractive\nindex. The refractive index of several media is given in Table 9.3. From\nthe T able you can know that the r efractive index of water , nw = 1.33.\nThis means that the ratio of the speed of light in air and the speed of\nlight in water is equal to 1.33.  Similarly, the refractive index of crown\nglass, ng =1.52. Such data ar e helpful in many places.  However , you\nneed not memorise the data.\nTable 9.3  Absolute refractive index of some material mediaMore to Know!\n2024-25\n\nScience 1509.3.3 Refraction by Spherical Lenses\nYou might have seen watchmakers using a small magnifying glass to\nsee tiny parts. Have you ever touched the surface of a magnifying glass\nwith your hand? Is it plane surface or curved? Is it thicker in the middle\nor at the edges? The glasses used in spectacles and that by a watchmaker\nare examples of lenses. What is a lens? How does it bend light rays? W e\nshall discuss these in this section.\nA transparent material bound by two surfaces, of which one or both\nsurfaces are spherical, forms a lens. This means\nthat a lens is bound by at least one spherical\nsurface. In such lenses, the other surface would\nbe plane.  A lens may have two spherical\nsurfaces, bulging outwards. Such a lens is called\na double convex lens. It is simply called a convex\nlens. It is thicker at the middle as compared to\nthe edges. Convex lens converges light rays as\nshown in Fig. 9.12 (a). Hence convex lenses are\nalso called converging lenses.  Similarly, a double\nconcave lens is bounded by two spherical\nsurfaces, curved inwards.  It is thicker at the\nedges than at the middle. Such lenses diverge\nlight rays as shown in Fig. 9.12 (b). Such lenses\nare also called diverging lenses. A double concave\nlens is simply called a concave lens.\nA lens, either a convex lens or a concave lens,\nhas two spherical surfaces. Each of these surfaces\nforms a part of a sphere. The centres of these\nspheres are called centres of curvature of the lens.\nThe centre of curvature of a lens is usually\nrepresented by the letter C.  Since there are two\ncentres of curvature, we may represent them as C1 and C2. An imaginary\nstraight line passing through the two centres of curvature of a lens is\ncalled its principal axis. The central point of a lens is its optical centre. It isQUESTIONS\n?1. A ray of light travelling in air enters obliquely into water . Does the light\nray bend towards the normal or away from the normal? Why?\n2. Light enters from air to glass having refractive index 1.50. What is the\nspeed of light in the glass? The speed of light in vacuum is 3 \u00d7 108 m s\u20131.\n3. Find out, from Table 9.3, the medium having highest optical density.\nAlso find the medium with lowest optical density.\n4. You ar e given ker osene, turpentine and water . In which of these does\nthe light travel fastest? Use the information given in Table 9.3.\n5. The refractive index of diamond is 2.42. What is the meaning of this\nstatement?\n(a)\nFigure 9.12Figure 9.12Figure 9.12Figure 9.12Figure 9.12\n(a) Converging action of a convex lens, (b) diverging\naction of a concave lens(b)\n2024-25\n\nLight \u2013 Reflection and Refraction 151usually represented by the letter O. A ray of light through the optical\ncentre of a lens passes without suffering any deviation. The effective\ndiameter of the circular outline of a spherical lens is called its aperture.\nWe shall confine our discussion in this Chapter to such lenses whose\naperture is much less than its radius of curvature  and the two centres of\ncurvatures are equidistant from the optical centre O. Such lenses are\ncalled thin lenses with small apertures. What happens when parallel rays\nof light are incident on a lens?  Let us do an Activity to understand this.\nActivity 9.11Activity 9.11Activity 9.11Activity 9.11Activity 9.11\nCAUTION : Do not look at the Sun directly or through a lens while\ndoing this Activity or otherwise. Y ou may damage your eyes if you\ndo so.\n/square6Hold a convex lens in your hand. Direct it towards the Sun.\n/square6Focus the light fr om the Sun on a sheet of paper . Obtain a sharp\nbright image of the Sun.\n/square6Hold the paper and the lens in the same position for a while.  Keep\nobserving the paper . What happened? Why? Recall your experience\nin Activity 9.2.\nThe paper begins to burn producing smoke. It may even catch fire\nafter a while.  Why does this happen? The light from the Sun constitutes\nparallel rays of light.  These rays were converged by the lens at the sharp\nbright spot for med on the paper .  In fact, the bright spot you got on the\npaper is a real image of the Sun. The concentration of the sunlight at a\npoint generated heat.  This caused the paper to burn.\nNow, we shall consider rays of light parallel to the principal axis of a\nlens.  What happens when you pass such rays of light through a lens?\nThis is illustrated for a convex lens in Fig.9.12 (a) and for a concave lens\nin Fig.9.12 (b).\nObserve Fig.9.12 (a) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a convex lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are converging to a point on the principal axis. This point\non the principal axis is called the principal focus of the lens. Let us see\nnow the action of a concave lens.\nObserve Fig.9.12 (b) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a concave lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are appearing to diverge from a point on the principal\naxis. This point on the principal axis is called the principal focus of the\nconcave lens.\nIf you pass parallel rays from the opposite surface of the lens, you\nget another principal focus on the opposite side. Letter F is usually used\nto represent principal focus. However , a lens has two principal foci.  They\nare represented by F1 and F2. The distance of the principal focus from\nthe optical centre of a lens is called its focal length. The letter f  is used to\nrepresent the focal length. How can you find the focal length of a convex\nlens? Recall the Activity 9.11. In this Activity, the distance between the\nposition of the lens and the position of the image of the Sun gives the\napproximate focal length of the lens.\n2024-25\n\nScience 1529.3.4 Image F ormation by Lenses\nLenses form images by refracting light.

Place it on the central line such\nthat the optical centre of the lens lies just over the line.\n/square6The two lines on either side of the lens correspond to F and 2F of\nthe lens respectively.  Mark them with appropriate letters such as\n2F1, F1, F2 and 2F2, respectively.\n/square6Place a burning candle, far beyond 2F1 to the left. Obtain a clear\nsharp image on a screen on the opposite side of the lens.\n/square6Note down the nature, position and relative size of the image.\n/square6Repeat this Activity by placing object just behind 2F1, between F1\nand 2F1 at F1, between F1 and O. Note down and tabulate your\nobservations.\nThe nature, position and relative size of the image formed by convex\nlens for various positions of the object is summarised in Table 9.4.\nLet us now do an Activity to study the nature, position and relative\nsize of the image formed by a concave lens.Table 9.4 Nature, position and relative size of the image formed by a convex lens for various\npositions of the object\nPosition of the Position of Relative size of Nature of\nobject the image  the image the image\nAt infinity At focus F2Highly diminished, Real and inverted\npoint-sized\nBeyond 2F1Between F2  and 2F2Diminished Real and inverted\nAt 2F1At 2F2Same size Real and inverted\nBetween F1 and 2F1Beyond 2F2Enlarged Real and inverted\nAt focus F1At infinity Infinitely large or Real and inverted\nhighly enlarged\nBetween focus F1On the same side Enlarged Virtual and erect\nand of the lens as the\noptical centre O object\n2024-25\n\nLight \u2013 Reflection and Refraction 153The summary of the above Activity is given in Table 9.5 below.Activity 9.13Activity 9.13Activity 9.13Activity 9.13Activity 9.13\n/square6Take a concave lens.

Note the change in the size\nof the image. What happens to the size of the image when the\ncandle is placed too far away from the lens.\nWhat conclusion can you draw from this Activity? A concave lens\nwill always give a virtual, erect and diminished image, irrespective of the\nposition of the object.\n9.3.5 Image F ormation in Lenses Using Ray Diagrams\n We can r epresent image for mation by lenses using ray diagrams. Ray\ndiagrams will also help us to study the nature, position and relative size\nof the image formed by lenses. For drawing ray diagrams in lenses, alike\nof spherical mirrors, we consider any two of the following rays \u2013\n(i)A ray of light from the object, parallel to the principal axis, after\nrefraction from a convex lens, passes through the principal focus\non the other side of the lens, as shown in Fig. 9.13 (a). In case of\na concave lens,\nthe ray appears\nto diverge from\nthe principal\nfocus located\non the same\nside of the lens,\nas shown in\nFig. 9.13 (b).(a) (b)Table 9.5  Nature, position and relative size of the image formed by a concave lens for various\npositions of the object\nPosition of the Position of Relative size of Nature of\nobject the image  the image the image\nAt infinity At focus F1Highly diminished, Virtual and erect\npoint-sized\nBetween infinity and Between focus F1Diminished Virtual and erect\noptical centre O and optical centre O\nof the lens\nFigure 9.13Figure 9.13Figure 9.13Figure 9.13Figure 9.13\n2024-25\n\nScience 154(ii)A ray of light passing\nthrough a principal\nfocus, after refraction\nfrom a convex lens, will\nemerge parallel to the\nprincipal axis. This is\nshown in Fig. 9.14 (a). A\nray of light appearing to\nmeet at the principal\nfocus of a concave lens,\nafter refraction, will\nemerge parallel to the\nprincipal axis. This is\nshown in Fig.9.14 (b).\n(iii)A ray of light passing\nthrough the optical\ncentre of a lens will\nemerge without any\ndeviation. This is\nillustrated in Fig.9.15(a)\nand Fig.9.15 (b).(b) (a)\n(b) (a)\nThe ray diagrams for the image formation in a convex lens for a few\npositions of the object are shown in Fig. 9.16. The ray diagrams\nrepresenting the image formation in a concave lens for various positions\nof the object are shown in Fig. 9.17.Figure 9.14Figure 9.14Figure 9.14Figure 9.14Figure 9.14\nFigure 9.15Figure 9.15Figure 9.15Figure 9.15Figure 9.15\n2024-25\n\nLight \u2013 Reflection and Refraction 155Figure 9.16Figure 9.16Figure 9.16Figure 9.16Figure 9.16  The position, size and the nature of the image formed by\na convex lens for various positions of the object\nFigure 9.17 Figure 9.17 Figure 9.17 Figure 9.17 Figure 9.17 Nature, position and relative size of the image formed by a concave lens\n9.3.6 Sign Convention for Spherical Lenses\nFor lenses, we follow sign convention, similar to the one used for spherical\nmirrors. W e apply the rules for signs of distances, except that all\nmeasurements are taken from the optical centre of the lens. According\nto the convention, the focal length of a convex lens is positive and that of\na concave lens is negative. Y ou must take car e to apply appropriate\nsigns for the values of u, v, f, object height h and image height h\u2032.\n9.3.7 Lens F ormula and Magnification\nAs we have a formula for spherical mirrors, we also have formula for\nspherical lenses. This formula gives the relationship between object-\ndistance ( u), image-distance ( v) and the focal length ( f).  The lens formula\nis expressed as\n1 1 1\nv u f\u2212 = (9.8)\nThe lens formula given above is general and is valid in all situations\nfor any spherical lens. Take proper care of the signs of different quantities,\nwhile putting numerical values for solving problems relating to lenses.\n2024-25\n\nScience 156Magnification\nThe magnification produced by a lens, similar to that for spherical\nmirrors, is defined as the ratio of the height of the image and the height\nof the object. Magnification is represented by the letter m . If h is the\nheight of the object and h\u2032 is the height of the image given by a lens, then\nthe magnification produced by the lens is given by,\nm = Height of the Image\nHeight of the object=h\nh\u2032(9.9)\nMagnification produced by a lens is also related to the object-distance\nu, and the image-distance v. This relationship is given by\nMagnification (m ) = h\u2032/h = v/u (9.10)\nExample 9.3\nA concave lens has focal length of 15 cm. At what distance should\nthe object from the lens be placed so that it forms an image at 10 cm\nfrom the lens? Also, find the magnification produced by the lens.\nSolution\nA concave lens always forms a virtual, erect image on the same side\nof the object.\nImage-distance v =\u201310 cm;\nFocal length f =\u201315 cm;\nObject-distance u=?\nSince 1 1 1\nv u f\u2212 =\nor,1 1 1\u2013u v f=\n( )1 1 1 1 1\u2013 \u2013\u201310 \u201315 10 15u= = +\n1 3 2 1\n30 30 u\u2212 += =\u2212\nor, u = \u2013 30 cm\nThus, the object-distance is 30 cm.\nMagnification m = v/u\nm = \u2212\n\u2212= +10cm\n30cm1\n30.33;\nThe positive sign shows that the image is erect and virtual. The image\nis one-third of the size of the object.\nExample 9.4\nA 2.0 cm tall object is placed perpendicular to the principal axis of a\nconvex lens of focal length 10 cm. The distance of the object from the\nlens is 15 cm. Find the nature, position and size of the image. Also\nfind its magnification.\n2024-25\n\nLight \u2013 Reflection and Refraction 157Solution\nHeight of the object h=+ 2.0 cm;\nFocal length f =+ 10 cm;\nobject-distance u =\u201315 cm;\nImage-distance v =?\nHeight of the image h\u2032=?\nSince1 1 1\nv u f\u2212 =\nor,1 1 1\nv u f= +\n1 1 1 1 1\n( 15) 10 15 10v= + = \u2212 +\u2212\n1 2 3 1\n30 30 v\u2212 += =\nor,v = + 30 cm\nThe positive sign of v shows that the image is formed at a distance of\n30 cm on the other side of the optical centre.  The image is real and\ninverted.\nMagnification m = 'h v\nh u=\nor,h\u2032 = h (v/u)\nHeight of the image, h\u2032 = (2.0) (+30/\u201315) = \u2013 4.0 cm\nMagnification m =  v/u\nor, 30cm215cmm+= = \u2212\u2212\nThe negative signs of m and h\u2032 show that the image is inverted and\nreal. It is formed below the principal axis. Thus, a real, inverted image,\n4 cm tall, is formed at a distance of 30 cm on the other side of the\nlens. The image is two times enlarged.\n9.3.8 Power of a Lens\nYou have alr eady lear nt that the ability of a lens to converge or diver ge\nlight rays depends on its focal length. For example, a convex lens of\nshort focal length bends the light rays through large angles, by focussing\nthem closer to the optical centre. Similarly, concave lens of very short\nfocal length causes higher divergence than the one with longer focal\nlength. The degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved\nby a lens is expr essed in ter ms of its power . The power of a lens is defined\nas the r eciprocal of its focal length. It is r epresented by the letter P.  The\npower P of a lens of focal length \nf is given by\nP = 1\nf(9.11)\n2024-25\n\nScience 158The SI unit of power of a lens is \u2018dioptre\u2019. It is denoted by the letter D.\nIf f is expressed in metres, then, power is expressed in dioptres. Thus,\n1 dioptre is the power of a lens whose focal length is 1 metre. 1D = 1m\u20131.\nYou may note that the power of a convex lens is positive and that of a\nconcave lens is negative.\nOpticians prescribe corrective lenses indicating their powers.  Let us\nsay the lens prescribed has power equal to + 2.0 D.  This means the lens\nprescribed is convex.  The focal length of the lens is + 0.50 m. Similarly,\na lens of power \u2013 2.5 D has a focal length of \u2013 0.40 m.  The lens is concave.\nMany optical instruments consist of a number of lenses. They are combined to increase\nthe magnification and sharpness of the image. The net power ( P) of the lenses placed\nin contact is given by the algebraic sum of the individual powers P1, P2, P3, \u2026   as\nP = P1 + P2 + P3 + \u2026\nThe use of powers, instead of focal lengths, for lenses is quite convenient for opticians.\nDuring eye-testing, an optician puts several different combinations of corrective lenses\nof known power , in contact, inside the testing spectacles\u2019 frame. The optician calculates\nthe power of the lens required by simple algebraic addition. For example, a combination\nof two lenses of power  + 2.0 D and + 0.25 D is equivalent to a single lens of power + 2.25 D.\nThe simple additive property of the powers of lenses can be used to design lens systems\nto minimise certain defects in images produced by a single lens.  Such a lens system,\nconsisting of several lenses, in contact, is commonly used in the design of lenses of\ncamera, microscopes and telescopes.\nQUESTIONS\n?1.

In this Chapter we will study about some more interesting\ncompounds and their properties. Also, we shall be learning about carbon,\nan element which is of immense significance to us in both its elemental\nform and in the combined form.\nThings made Things made Others\nof metal of glass/clayActivity 4.1Activity 4.1Activity 4.1Activity 4.1Activity 4.1\n/square6Make a list of ten things you have used\nor consumed since the morning.\n/square6Compile this list with the lists made by\nyour classmates and then sort the items\ninto the adjacent Table.\n/square6If there are items which are made up of\nmore than one material, put them into\nboth the relevant columns of the table.\nLook at the items that come in the last column of the above table\nfilled by you \u2013 your teacher will be able to tell you that most of them are\nmade up of compounds of carbon. Can you think of a method to test\nthis? What would be the product if a compound containing carbon is\nburnt? Do you know of any test to confirm this?\nFood, clothes, medicines, books, or many of the things that you listed\nare all based on this versatile element carbon. In addition, all living\nstructures are carbon based. The amount of carbon present in the earth\u2019s\ncrust and in the atmosphere is quite meagre. The earth\u2019s crust has only\n0.02% carbon in the form of minerals (like carbonates, hydrogen-\ncarbonates, coal and petroleum) and the atmosphere has 0.03% of carbon\ndioxide. In spite of this small amount of carbon available in nature, the\nimportance of carbon seems to be immense. In this Chapter , we will know\nabout the properties of carbon which make carbon so important to us.\n4.1 BONDING IN CARBON \u2013 THE CO VALENT BOND\nIn the pr evious Chapter , we have studied the pr operties of ionic\ncompounds. W e saw that ionic compounds have high melting and boiling\npoints and conduct electricity in solution or in the molten state. W e also\n2024-25\n\nCarbon and its Compounds 59saw how the nature of bonding in ionic compounds explains these\nproperties. Let us now study the properties of some carbon compounds.\nMost carbon compounds are poor conductors of electricity as we\nhave seen in Chapter 2. From the data\ngiven in Table 4.1 on the boiling and\nmelting points of the carbon compounds,\nwe find that these compounds have low\nmelting and boiling points as compared\nto ionic compounds (Chapter 3). W e can\nconclude that the forces of attraction\nbetween the molecules are not very\nstrong. Since these compounds are\nlargely non-conductors of electricity, we\ncan conclude that the bonding in these\ncompounds does not give rise to any ions.\nIn Class IX, we learnt about the\ncombining capacity of various elements and how it depends on the\nnumber of valence electrons. Let us now look at the electronic\nconfiguration of carbon. The atomic number of carbon is 6. What would\nbe the distribution of electrons in various shells of carbon? How many\nvalence electrons will carbon have?\nWe know that the r eactivity of elements is explained as their tendency\nto attain a completely filled outer shell, that is, attain noble gas\nconfiguration. Elements forming ionic compounds achieve this by either\ngaining or losing electrons from the outermost shell. In the case of carbon,\nit has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs to gain or lose four\nelectrons to attain noble gas configuration. If it were to gain or lose\nelectrons \u2013\n(i)It could gain four electrons forming C4\u2013 anion. But it would be difficult\nfor the nucleus with six protons to hold on to ten electrons, that is,\nfour extra electrons.\n(ii)It could lose four electrons forming C4+ cation. But it would require\na large amount of energy to remove four electrons leaving behind a\ncarbon cation with six protons in its nucleus holding on to just two\nelectrons.\nCarbon overcomes this problem by sharing its valence electrons with\nother atoms of carbon or with atoms of other elements. Not just carbon,\nbut many other elements form molecules by sharing electrons in this\nmanner . The shar ed electr ons \u2018belong\u2019 to the outer most shells of both\nthe atoms and lead to both atoms attaining the noble gas configuration.\nBefore going on to compounds of carbon, let us look at some simple\nmolecules formed by the sharing of valence electrons.\nThe simplest molecule formed in this manner is that of hydrogen.\nAs you have lear nt earlier , the atomic number of hydrogen is 1. Hence\nhydrogen has one electron in its K shell and it requires one more electron\nto fill the K shell. So two hydrogen atoms share their electrons to form a\nmolecule of hydrogen, H2. This allows each hydrogen atom to attain theTable 4.1 Melting points and boiling points of some\ncompounds of carbon\nCompound Melting Boiling\npoint (K) point (K)\nAcetic acid (CH3COOH) 290 391\nChloroform (CHCl3) 209 334\nEthanol (CH3CH2OH) 156 351\nMethane (CH4) 90 111\n2024-25\n\nScience 60Figure 4.4Figure 4.4Figure 4.4Figure 4.4Figure 4.4\nTriple bond between\ntwo nitrogen atoms\nFigure 4.3Figure 4.3Figure 4.3Figure 4.3Figure 4.3\nDouble bond between\ntwo oxygen atoms\nelectronic configuration of the nearest noble gas,\nhelium, which has two electr ons in its K shell. W e can\ndepict this using dots or crosses to represent valence\nelectrons (Fig. 4.1).\nThe shared pair of electrons is said to constitute a\nsingle covalent bond between the two hydrogen atoms.\nA single covalent bond is also represented by a line\nbetween the two atoms, as shown in Fig. 4.2.\nThe atomic number of chlorine is 17. What would be its electronic\nconfiguration and its valency? Chlorine forms a diatomic molecule, Cl2.\nCan you draw the electron dot structure for this molecule? Note that\nonly the valence shell electrons need to be depicted.\nIn the case of oxygen, we see the formation of a double bond between\ntwo oxygen atoms. This is because an atom of oxygen has six electrons\nin its L shell (the atomic number of oxygen is eight) and it requires two\nmore electrons to complete its octet. So each atom of oxygen shares two\nelectrons with another atom of oxygen to give us the structure shown in\nFig. 4.3. The two electrons contributed by each oxygen atom give rise to\ntwo shared pairs of electrons. This is said to constitute a double bond\nbetween the two atoms.\nCan you now depict a molecule of water showing the nature\nof bonding between one oxygen atom and two hydrogen\natoms? Does the molecule have single bonds or double bonds?\nWhat would happen in the case of a diatomic molecule of\nnitrogen? Nitrogen has the atomic number 7. What would be\nits electronic configuration and its combining capacity? In\norder to attain an octet, each nitrogen atom in a molecule of\nnitrogen contributes three electrons giving rise to three shared\npairs of electrons. This is said to constitute a triple bond\nbetween the two atoms. The electron dot structure of N2 and\nits triple bond can be depicted as in Fig. 4.4.\nA molecule of ammonia has the formula NH3. Can you draw\nthe electron dot structure for this molecule showing how all\nfour atoms achieve noble gas configuration? Will the molecule\nhave single, double or triple bonds?\nLet us now take a look at methane, which is a compound\nof carbon. Methane is widely used as a fuel and is a major\ncomponent of bio-gas and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). It\nis also one of the simplest compounds formed by carbon.\nMethane has a formula CH4. Hydrogen, as you know, has a\nvalency of 1. Carbon is tetravalent because it has four valence\nelectrons. In order to achieve noble gas configuration, carbon\nshares these electrons with four atoms of hydrogen as shown\nin Fig. 4.5.\nSuch bonds which are formed by the sharing of an electron pair\nbetween two atoms are known as covalent bonds. Covalently bonded\nmolecules ar e seen to have str ong bonds within the molecule, but inter -\nmolecular forces are weak. This gives rise to the low melting and boiling\nFigure 4.1Figure 4.1Figure 4.1Figure 4.1Figure 4.1\nA molecule of hydrogen\nFigure 4.2Figure 4.2Figure 4.2Figure 4.2Figure 4.2\nSingle bond between\ntwo hydrogen atoms\n2024-25\n\nCarbon and its Compounds 61These two different structures result in diamond and graphite having very different\nphysical properties even though their chemical properties are the same. Diamond is\nthe hardest substance known while graphite is smooth and slippery. Graphite is also\na very good conductor of electricity unlike other non-metals that you studied in the\nprevious Chapter .\nDiamonds can be synthesised by subjecting pure carbon to very high pressure and\ntemperature. These synthetic diamonds are small but are otherwise indistinguishable\nfrom natural diamonds.\nFullerenes form another class of carbon allotropes. The first one to be identified was\nC-60 which has carbon atoms arranged in the shape of a football. Since this looked\nlike the geodesic dome designed by the US ar chitect Buckminster Fuller , the molecule\nwas named fullerene.The structure of diamondThe structure of C-60\nBuckminsterfullerene\nQUESTIONS\n?1. What would be the electron dot structure of carbon dioxide which has\nthe formula CO2?\n2. What would be the electron dot structure of a molecule of sulphur which\nis made up of eight atoms of sulphur? ( Hint \u2013  The eight atoms of sulphur\nare joined together in the form of a ring.)\nFigure 4.5Figure 4.5Figure 4.5Figure 4.5Figure 4.5\nElectron dot structure for\nmethanepoints of these compounds. Since the electrons are shared between\natoms and no charged particles are formed, such covalent compounds\nare generally poor conductors of electricity.\nAllotropes of carbon\nThe element carbon occurs in different forms in nature with\nwidely varying physical properties. Both diamond and\ngraphite are formed by carbon atoms, the difference lies in\nthe manner in which the carbon atoms are bonded to one\nanother . In diamond, each carbon atom is bonded to four\nother carbon atoms forming a rigid three-dimensional\nstructure. In graphite, each carbon atom is bonded to three\nother carbon atoms in the same plane giving a hexagonal array.\nOne of these bonds is a double-bond, and thus the valency of\ncarbon is satisfied. Graphite structure is formed by the\nhexagonal arrays being placed in layers one above the other .More to Know!\nThe structure of graphite\n2024-25\n\nScience 624.2 VERS ATILE NA TURE OF CARBON\nWe have seen the for mation of covalent bonds by the sharing of\nelectr ons in various elements and compounds. W e have also seen the\nstructure of a simple carbon compound, methane. In the beginning\nof the Chapter , we saw how many things we use contain carbon. In\nfact, we ourselves are made up of carbon compounds. The numbers\nof carbon compounds whose formulae are known to chemists was\nrecently estimated to be in million s! This outnumbers by a large\nmargin the compounds for med by all the other elements put together .\nWhy is it that this property is seen in carbon and no other element?\nThe nature of the covalent bond enables carbon to form a large number\nof compounds. Two factors noticed in the case of carbon ar e \u2013\n(i)Carbon has the unique ability to form bonds with other atoms of\ncarbon, giving rise to large molecules. This property is called\ncatenation. These compounds may have long chains of carbon,\nbranched chains of carbon or even carbon atoms arranged in rings.\nIn addition, carbon atoms may be linked by single, double or triple\nbonds. Compounds of carbon, which are linked by only single\nbonds between the carbon atoms are called saturated compounds.\nCompounds of carbon having double or triple bonds between their\ncarbon atoms are called unsaturated compounds.\nNo other element exhibits the property of catenation to the extent\nseen in carbon compounds. Silicon forms compounds with\nhydrogen which have chains of upto seven or eight atoms, but these\ncompounds are very reactive. The carbon-carbon bond is very strong\nand hence stable. This gives us the large number of compounds\nwith many carbon atoms linked to each other .\n(ii)Since carbon has a valency of four , it is capable of bonding with\nfour other atoms of carbon or atoms of some other mono-valent\nelement. Compounds of carbon are formed with oxygen, hydrogen,\nnitrogen, sulphur , chlorine and many other elements giving rise to\ncompounds with specific properties which depend on the elements\nother than carbon present in the molecule.\nAgain the bonds that carbon forms with most other elements are\nvery strong making these compounds exceptionally stable. One\nreason for the formation of strong bonds by carbon is its small size.\nThis enables the nucleus to hold on to the shared pairs of electrons\nstrongly. The bonds formed by elements having bigger atoms are\nmuch weaker .\n2024-25"

This principle marks a departure\nfrom the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes\na gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed\non the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt\nto discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different\nsubject ar eas. W e hope these measur es will take us significantly further in the dir ection\nof a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education\n(1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers\nwill take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative\nactivities and questions. W e must r ecognise that, given space, time and fr eedom, childr en\ngenerate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.\nTreating the pr\nescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key\nreasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity\nand initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning,\nnot as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning.\nFlexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual\ncalendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching.\nThe methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this\ntextbook proves for making children\u2019s life at school a happy experience, rather than a\nsource of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of\ncurricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with\ngreater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The\ntextbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to\nopportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and\nactivities requiring hands-on experience.\nThe National Council of Educational Resear ch and T raining (NCER T) appr eciates\nthe har d work done by the textbook development team responsible for this book. W e\nwish to thank the Chairman of the advisory group in science and mathematics, Professor\nJ.V.

The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing\nthe content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with\ncreative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the\nexercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes\nalready developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into\nconsideration in this exercise.\nContents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:\n\u2022Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the\nsame class\n\u2022Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject\n\u2022Difficulty level\n\u2022Content, which is easily accessible to students without much\ninterventions from teachers and can be learned by children through\nself-learning or peer-learning\n\u2022Content, which is irrelevant in the present context\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the\nchanges given above.\n2024-25\n\n2024-25\n\nThis textbook of Science for Class X is a continuation of our attempt in the Class IX\nScience textbook to comply with the guidelines of the National Curriculum\nFramework-2005. W e had to work within a limited time frame and also had our own\nconstraints coming in the way of this radical change. The revised and re-structured\nsyllabus for Class X covers selected topics in the broad themes of \u2014 Materials,\nThe W orld of the Living, How Things W ork, Natural Phenomena and Natural Resour ces.\nWe have interpr eted the syllabus to pr esent a coher ent coverage of scientific concepts\nrelated to our daily life on the select topics. It is an integrated approach to science at\nthis level, with no sharp divisions into disciplines such as Physics, Chemistry, Biology\nand Environmental Science.\nThere has been a conscious attempt to address the relevant social concerns in this\nscience textbook wherever possible \u2014 the concerns for people with special needs, the\nissues of gender discrimination, energy and environment have found their natural\nplace in this book. Students have been encouraged to get into the debates on some of\nthe management concerns (for sustainable development, for example) so that they\ncan arrive at their own decisions after a scientific analysis of all the facts.\nThis book has some features which are meant to enhance its effectiveness. The\ntheme of each chapter has been introduced with examples from daily life, and if possible,\nby a relevant activity that the students have to perform. The entire approach of the\nbook  is, in fact, activity-based, i.e., the students are required to construct knowledge\nthemselves from these activities. The emphasis is not on definitions and technical\nterms, but on the concepts involved. Special care has been taken so that the rigour of\nscience is not lost while simplifying the language. Difficult and challenging ideas,\nwhich are not to be covered at this stage, have often been placed as extra material in\nthe boxes in light orange. The excitement of doing science comes from pursuing the\nunknown \u2014 the students would have the opportunity to think and explore somewhat\nbeyond the syllabus and may feel the urge to continue their scientific expedition at\nhigher levels. All such box items, including brief biography of scientists, are, of course,\nnon-evaluative.\nSolved examples are provided, wherever felt necessary, to clarify a concept. The\nin-text questions after a main section are for the students to check their understanding\nof the topic. At the end of each chapter , ther e is a quick r eview of the important points\ncover ed in the chapter . We have intr oduced some multiple choice questions in the\nexercises. There are problems of different difficulty levels answers to the multiple-\nchoice questions and numericals, and hints for the difficult questions are included at\nthe end of the book.PREFACE\n2024-25\n\n(viii)This book has been made possible because of the active participation of many\npeople. I wish to thank Pr ofessor Krishna Kumar , Director , NCER T, Prof. G. Ravindra,\nJoint Dir ector , NCER T, and Pr ofessor Hukum Singh, Head, Department of Education\nin Science and Mathematics, NCER T, specially for their keen inter est in the development\nof the book and for all the administrative support.

            "text": "Electricity11 CHAPTER\nElectricity has an important place in modern society. It is a controllable\nand convenient form of energy for a variety of uses in homes, schools,\nhospitals, industries and so on. What constitutes electricity? How does\nit flow in an electric circuit? What are the factors that control or regulate\nthe curr ent thr ough an electric cir cuit? In this Chapter , we shall attempt\nto answer such questions. W e shall also discuss the heating ef fect of\nelectric current and its applications.\n11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT\nWe are familiar with air curr ent and water curr ent. W e know that flowing\nwater constitute water current in rivers. Similarly, if the electric charge\nflows through a conductor (for example, through a metallic wire), we\nsay that ther e is an electric curr ent in the conductor . In a tor ch, we\nknow that the cells (or a battery, when placed in proper order) provide\nflow of char ges or an electric curr ent thr ough the tor ch bulb to glow. W e\nhave also seen that the torch gives light only when its switch is on. What\ndoes a switch do? A switch makes a conducting link between the cell and\nthe bulb. A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called an\nelectric circuit. Now, if the circuit is broken anywhere (or the switch of the\ntorch is turned off), the current stops flowing and the bulb does not glow.\nHow do we express electric current? Electric current is expressed by\nthe amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time. In\nother words, it is the rate of flow of electric charges. In circuits using\nmetallic wir es, electr ons constitute the flow of char ges. However , electr ons\nwere not known at the time when the phenomenon of electricity was first\nobserved. So, electric current was considered to be the flow of positive\ncharges and the direction of flow of positive charges was taken to be the\ndirection of electric current. Conventionally, in an electric circuit the\ndirection of electric current is taken as opposite to the direction of the\nflow of electrons, which are negative charges.\n2024-25\n\nScience 172If a net charge Q, flows across any cross-section of a conductor in\ntime t , then the current I, through the cross-section is\nIQ\nt= (11.1)\nThe SI unit of electric charge is coulomb (C), which is equivalent to\nthe char ge contained in nearly 6 \u00d7 1018 electr ons. (W e know that an\nelectron possesses a negative charge of 1.6 \u00d7 10\u201319 C.) The electric\ncurrent is expressed by a unit called ampere (A), named after the\nFrench scientist, Andre-Marie Ampere (1775\u20131836). One ampere is\nconstituted by the flow of one coulomb of charge per second, that is,\n1 A = 1 C/1 s. Small quantities of current are expressed in milliampere\n(1 mA = 10\u20133 A) or in microampere (1 \u00b5A = 10\u20136 A).\nAn instrument called ammeter measures electric\ncurrent in a circuit. It is always connected in series\nin a circuit through which the current is to be\nmeasured. Figure 11.1 shows the schematic\ndiagram of a typical electric circuit comprising a\ncell, an electric bulb, an ammeter and a plug key.\nNote that the electric current flows in the circuit\nfrom the positive ter minal of the cell to the negative\nterminal of the cell thr ough the bulb and ammeter .\nFigure 11.1Figure 11.1Figure 11.1Figure 11.1Figure 11.1\nA schematic diagram of an electric circuit\ncomprising \u2013 cell, electric bulb, ammeter and\nplug key\nQUESTIONS\n?Example 11.1\nA current of 0.5 A is drawn by a filament of an electric bulb for 10\nminutes. Find the amount of electric charge that flows through the\ncircuit.\nSolution\nWe are given, I = 0.5 A; t = 10 min = 600 s.\nFrom Eq. (11.1), we have\nQ=It\n=0.5 A \u00d7 600 s\n=300 C\n1. What does an electric circuit mean?\n2. Define the unit of current.\n3. Calculate the number of electrons constituting one coulomb of charge.\n2024-25\n\nElectricity 17311.2 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL AND POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE11.2 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL AND POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE11.2 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL AND POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE11.2 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL AND POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE11.2 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL AND POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE\nWhat makes the electric charge to flow? Let us consider the analogy of\nflow of water . Char ges do not flow in a copper wir e by themselves, just as\nwater in a perfectly horizontal tube does not flow. If one end of the tube\nis connected to a tank of water kept at a higher level, such that there is a\npressure difference between the two ends of the tube, water flows out of\nthe other end of the tube. For flow of charges in a conducting metallic\nwire, the gravity, of course, has no role to play; the electrons move only\nif there is a difference of electric pressure \u2013 called the potential differenc e \u2013\nalong the conductor . This dif ference of potential may be pr oduced by a\nbattery, consisting of one or more electric cells. The chemical action within\na cell generates the potential difference across the terminals of the cell,\neven when no current is drawn from it. When the cell is connected to a\nconducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges in\nmotion in the conductor and produces an electric current. In order to\nmaintain the current in a given electric circuit, the cell has to expend its\nchemical energy stored in it.\nWe define the electric potential dif ference between two points in an\nelectric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit\ncharge from one point to the other \u2013\nPotential dif fer\nence ( V) between two points = Work done ( W)/Char ge (Q)\nV=W/Q (11.2)\nThe SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named after\nAlessandr o Volta (174 5\u20131827), an Italian physicist. One volt is the\npotential difference between two points in a current carrying conductor\nwhen 1 joule of work is done to move a charge of 1 coulomb from one\npoint to the other .\nTherefore, 1 volt =  1 joule\n1 coulomb\n(11.3)\n1 V  = 1 J C\u20131\nThe potential difference is measured by means of an instrument called\nthe voltmeter . The voltmeter is always connected in parallel across the\npoints between which the potential difference is to be measured.\nExample 11.2\nHow much work is done in moving a charge of 2 C across two points\nhaving a potential difference 12 V?\nSolution\nThe amount of charge Q,  that flows between two points at potential\ndifference V (= 12 V) is 2 C. Thus, the amount of work W, done in\nmoving the charge [from Eq. (11.2)] is\n2024-25\n\nScience 174W= VQ\n= 12 V \u00d7 2 C\n= 24 J.\nQUESTIONS\n?\n11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM\nWe know that an electric cir cuit, as shown in Fig. 11.1, comprises a cell\n(or a battery), a plug key, electrical component(s), and connecting wires.\nIt is often convenient to draw a schematic diagram, in which different\ncomponents of the circuit are represented by the symbols conveniently\nused. Conventional symbols  used to represent some of the most\ncommonly used electrical components are given in Table 11.1.\nTable 11.1 Symbols of some commonly used components in circuit diagrams\nSl.

Let us explore with an Activity.\nActivity 11.1Activity 11.1Activity 11.1Activity 11.1Activity 11.1\n/square6Set up a circuit as shown in Fig. 11.2,\nconsisting of a nichrome wire XY of length,\nsay 0.5 m, an ammeter , a voltmeter and\nfour cells of 1.5 V each. (Nichrome is an\nalloy of nickel, chromium, manganese, and\niron metals.)\n/square6First use only one cell as the source in the\ncircuit. Note the reading in the ammeter I,\nfor the current and reading of the voltmeter\nV for the potential difference across the\nnichrome wire XY in the circuit. Tabulate\nthem in the Table given.\n/square6Next connect two cells in the circuit and\nnote the respective readings of the ammeter and voltmeter for the values of current through\nthe nichrome wire and potential difference across the nichrome wire.\n/square6Repeat the above steps using three cells and then four cells in the circuit separately.\n/square6Calculate the ratio of V to I for each pair of potential difference V and current I.\nS.

A\nstraight line plot shows that as the\ncurrent through a wire increases, the\npotential difference across the wire\nincreases linearly  \u2013 this is Ohm\u2019s law.\nActivity 11.2Activity 11.2Activity 11.2Activity 11.2Activity 11.2\n/square6Take a nichrome wire, a torch bulb, a 10 W bulb and an ammeter (0 \u2013 5 A range), a plug\nkey and some connecting wires.\n/square6Set up the circuit by connecting four dry cells of 1.5 V each in series with the ammeter\nleaving a gap XY in the circuit, as shown in Fig. 11.4.In this Activity, you will find that approximately the\nsame value for V/I  is obtained in each case. Thus the V\u2013I\ngraph is a straight line that passes through the origin of\nthe graph, as shown in Fig. 11.3. Thus, \nV/I is a constant\nratio.\nIn 1827, a German physicist Georg Simon Ohm\n(1787\u20131854) found out the relationship between the current\nI, flowing in a metallic wire and the potential difference\nacross its terminals. The potential difference, V, across the\nends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly\nproportional to the current flowing through it,  provided its\ntemperature remains the same. This is called Ohm\u2019s law. In\nother words \u2013\nV \u221d I (11.4)\nor V/I =constant\n=R\nor V =IR (11.5)\nIn Eq. (11.4), R is a constant for the given metallic wire\nat a given temperature and is called its resistance. It is the\nproperty of a conductor to resist the flow of charges  through it. Its SI\nunit is ohm, r epresented by the Gr eek letter \u2126. Accor ding to Ohm\u2019s law,\nR = V/I (11.6)\nIf the potential difference across the two ends of a conductor is 1 V\nand the current through it is 1 A, then the resistance R, of the conductor\nis 1 \u2126. That is, 1 ohm = 1 volt\n1 ampere\nAlso from Eq. (11.5) we get\nI = V/R (11.7)\nIt is obvious from Eq. (11.7) that the current through a resistor is\ninversely proportional to its resistance. If the resistance is doubled the\ncurrent gets halved. In many practical cases it is necessary to increase\nor decrease the current in an electric circuit. A component used to\nregulate current without changing the voltage source is called variable\nresistance. In an electric circuit, a device called rheostat is often used to\nchange the resistance in the cir cuit. W e will now study about electrical\nresistance of a conductor with the help of following Activity.\n2024-25\n\nElectricity 177In this Activity we observe that the current is different for different\ncomponents. Why do they differ? Certain components offer an easy path\nfor the flow of electric curr ent while the others r esist the flow. W e know\nthat motion of electrons in an electric circuit constitutes an electric\ncurrent. The electr ons, however , are not completely fr ee to move within a\nconductor . They ar e restrained by the attraction of the atoms among\nwhich they move. Thus, motion of electrons through a conductor is\nretarded by its resistance. A component of a given size that offers a low\nresistance is a good conductor . A conductor having some appreciable\nresistance is called a r esistor . A component of identical size that of fers a\nhigher r esistance is a poor conductor . An insulator of the same size of fers\neven higher resistance.\n11.5 FA11.5 FA11.5 FA\n11.5 FA11.5 FA CTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTCTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTCTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTCTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTCTORS ON WHICH THE RESIST ANCE OF AANCE OF AANCE OF AANCE OF AANCE OF A\nCONDUCTOR DEPENDSCONDUCTOR DEPENDSCONDUCTOR DEPENDSCONDUCTOR DEPENDSCONDUCTOR DEPENDSFigure 11.4Figure 11.4Figure 11.4Figure 11.4Figure 11.4\n/square6Complete the cir cuit by connecting the nichr ome wir e in the gap XY .

[Note:  Always take out the key\nfrom the plug after measuring the current through the circuit. ]\n/square6Replace the nichrome wire with the torch bulb in the circuit and find the current through\nit by measuring the r eading of the ammeter .\n/square6Now r epeat the above step with the 10 W bulb in the gap XY .\n/square6Are the ammeter readings different for different components connected in the gap XY?\nWhat do the above observations indicate?\n/square6You may r epeat this Activity by keeping any material component in the gap. Observe the\nammeter readings in each case. Analyse the observations.\nActivity 11.3Activity 11.3Activity 11.3Activity 11.3Activity 11.3\n/square6Complete an electric cir cuit consisting of a cell, an ammeter , a nichrome wir e of length l\n[say, marked (1)]  \nand a plug key, as shown in Fig. 11.5.\n2024-25\n\nScience 178It is observed that the ammeter reading decreases to one-half when\nthe length of the wire is doubled. The ammeter reading is increased when\na thicker wire of the same material and of the same length is used in the\ncircuit. A change in ammeter reading is observed when a wire of different\nmaterial of the same length and the same area of cross-section is used.\nOn applying Ohm\u2019s law [Eqs. (11.5) \u2013 (11.7)], we observe that the\nresistance of the conductor depends (i) on its length, (ii) on its area of\ncross-section, and (iii) on the nature of its material. Precise measurements\nhave shown that resistance of a uniform metallic conductor is directly\nproportional to its length (l ) and inversely proportional to the area of\ncross-section ( A). That is,\nR \u221d l (11.8)\nand R \u221d 1/A (11.9)\nCombining Eqs. (11.8) and (11.9) we get\nR \u221d l\nA\nor, R = \u03c1l\nA(11.10)\nwhere \u03c1 (rho) is a constant of proportionality and is called the electrical\nresistivity of the material of the conductor . The SI unit of r esistivity is\n\u2126 m. It is a characteristic property of the material.

A\nthicker wire has a larger cross-sectional area. Again note down the current through the\ncircuit.\n/square6Instead of taking a nichrome wire, connect a copper wire [marked (4) in Fig. 11.5] in the\ncircuit. Let the wire be of the same length and same area of cross-section as that of the\nfirst nichrome wire [marked (1)]. Note the value of the current.\n/square6Notice the difference in the current in all cases.\n/square6Does the current depend on the length of the conductor?\n/square6Does the current depend on the area of cross-section of the wire used?\n2024-25\n\nElectricity 179have very low resistivity in the  range of 10\u20138 \u2126 m to  10\u20136 \u2126 m. They are\ngood conductors of electricity. Insulators like rubber and glass have\nresistivity of the order of 1012 to 1017 \u2126 m. Both the resistance and\nresistivity of a material vary with temperature.\nTable 11.2 reveals that the resistivity of an alloy is generally higher\nthan that of its constituent metals. Alloys do not oxidise (burn) readily\nat high temperatures. For this reason, they are commonly used in\nelectrical heating devices, like electric iron, toasters etc. Tungsten is used\nalmost exclusively for filaments of electric bulbs, whereas copper and\naluminium are generally used for electrical transmission lines.\nTable 11.2  Electrical resistivity*  of some substances at 20\u00b0C\nMaterial Resistivity ( \u2126\u2126\u2126\n\u2126\u2126 m)\nConductors Silver 1.60 \u00d7 10\u20138\nCopper 1.62 \u00d7 10\u20138\nAluminium 2.63 \u00d7 10\u20138\nTungsten 5.20 \u00d7 10\u20138\nNickel 6.84 \u00d7 10\u20138\nIron 10.0 \u00d7 10\u20138\nChromium 12.9 \u00d7 10\u20138\nMercury 94.0 \u00d7 10\u20138\nManganese 1.84 \u00d7 10\u20136\nAlloys Constantan 49 \u00d7 10\u20136\n(alloy of Cu and Ni)\nManganin 44 \u00d7 10\u20136\n(alloy of Cu, Mn and Ni)\nNichrome 100 \u00d7 10\u20136\n(alloy of Ni, Cr, Mn and Fe)\nInsulators Glass 1010 \u2013 1014\nHard rubber 1013 \u2013 1016\nEbonite 1015 \u2013 1017\nDiamond 1012 - 1013\nPaper (dry) 1012\n* You need not memorise these values.

(b) How much\ncurrent will an electric heater coil draw from a 220 V source, if\nthe resistance of the heater coil is 100 \u2126?\nSolution\n(a)We are given V = 220 V ; R = 1200 \u2126.\nFrom Eq.

If the\ndiameter of the wire is 0.3 mm, what will be the resistivity of the\nmetal at that temperature? Using Table 11.2, predict the material\nof the wire.\nSolution\nWe are given the resistance R of the wir\ne = 26 \u2126 , the diameter\nd = 0.3 mm = 3 \u00d7 10-4 m, and the length l  of the wire = 1 m.\nTherefore, from Eq.

From\nTable 11.2, we see that this is the resistivity of manganese.\nExample 11.6\nA wire of given material having length l and area of cross-section A\nhas a resistance of 4 \u2126.

W e\nhave noticed how the current through a conductor depends upon its\nresistance and the potential difference across its ends. In various electrical\ngadgets, we often use resistors in various combinations. W e now ther efore\nintend to see how Ohm\u2019s law can be applied to combinations of resistors.\nThere are two methods of joining the r esistors together . Figur e 11.6\nshows an electric circuit in which three resistors having resistances R1,\nR2 and R3, respectively, are joined end to end. Here the resistors are said\nto be connected in series.\nFigure 11.6Figure 11.6Figure 11.6Figure 11.6Figure 11.6  Resistors in series\n2024-25\n\nScience 182Figure 11.7Figure 11.7Figure 11.7Figure 11.7Figure 11.7  Resistors in parallel\nYou will observe that the value of the current in the ammeter is the\nsame, independent of its position in the electric circuit. It means that in\na series combination of resistors the current is the same in every part of\nthe cir cuit or the same curr ent thr ough each r esistor .Activity 11.4Activity 11.4Activity 11.4Activity 11.4Activity 11.4\n/square6Join three resistors of different values in series. Connect them\nwith a battery, an ammeter and a plug key, as shown in Fig. 11.6.\nYou may use the r esistors of values like 1 \u2126, 2 \u2126, 3 \u2126 etc., and a\nbattery of 6 V for performing this Activity.\n/square6Plug the key. Note the ammeter reading.\n/square6Change the position of ammeter to anywhere in between the\nresistors. Note the ammeter reading each time.\n/square6Do you find any change in the value of current through the\nammeter?11.6.1 Resistors in Series\nWhat happens to the value of current when a number of resistors are\nconnected in series in a circuit? What would be their equivalent\nresistance? Let us try to understand these with the help of the following\nactivities.Figure 11.7 shows a combination of resistors in which three resistors\nare connected together between points X and Y . Here, the r esistors ar e\nsaid to be connected in parallel.\n2024-25\n\nElectricity 183Activity 11.5Activity 11.5Activity 11.5Activity 11.5Activity 11.5\n/square6In Activity 11.4, insert a voltmeter across the ends X and Y of the\nseries combination of three resistors, as shown in Fig. 11.6.\n/square6Plug the key in the circuit and note the voltmeter reading. It\ngives the potential difference across the series combination of\nresistors. Let it be V. Now measur e the potential dif ference acr oss\nthe two terminals of the battery. Compare the two values.\n/square6Take out the plug key and disconnect the voltmeter . Now insert\nthe voltmeter acr oss the ends X and P of the first r esistor , as\nshown in Fig. 11.8.\nFigure 11.8Figure 11.8Figure 11.8Figure 11.8Figure 11.8\n/square6Plug the key and measure the potential difference across the first\nresistor . Let it be V1.\n/square6Similarly, measure the potential difference across the other two\nresistors, separately. Let these values be V2 and V3, respectively.\n/square6Deduce a relationship between V, V1, V2 and V3.\nYou will observe that the potential dif ference V is equal to the sum of\npotential differences V1, V2, and V3. That is the total potential difference\nacross a combination of resistors in series is equal to the sum of potential\ndifference across the individual resistors. That is,\nV = V1 + V2  + V3(11.11)\nIn the electric circuit shown in Fig. 11.8, let I be the current through\nthe circuit. The current through each resistor is also I. It is possible to\nreplace the three resistors joined in series by an equivalent single resistor\nof resistance \nR, such that the potential difference V across it, and the\ncurrent I through the circuit remains the same. Applying the Ohm\u2019s law\nto the entire circuit, we have\nV = I R (11.12)\n2024-25\n\nScience 184On applying Ohm\u2019s law to the three resistors separately, we further\nhave\nV1=I R1[11.13(a)]\nV2=I R2[11.13(b)]\nand V3=I R3[11.13(c)]\nFrom Eq. (11.11),\nI R= I R1 + I R2 + I R3\nor\nRs= R1 +R2 + R3(11.14)\nWe can conclude that when several r esistors ar e joined in series, the\nresistance of the combination Rs equals the sum of their individual\nresistances, R1, R2, R3, and is thus greater than any individual resistance.\nExample 11.7\nAn electric lamp, whose resistance is 20 \u2126, and a conductor of 4 \u2126\nresistance are connected to a 6 V battery (Fig. 11.9). Calculate (a) the\ntotal resistance of the circuit, (b) the current through the circuit, and (c)\nthe potential dif ference acr oss the electric lamp and conductor .\nSolution\nThe resistance of electric lamp, R1 = 20 \u2126 ,\nThe r esistance of the conductor connected in series, R2 = 4 \u2126.\nThen the total resistance in the circuit\nR=R1 + R2\nRs=20 \u2126\n + 4 \u2126 = 24 \u2126.\nThe total potential difference across the two terminals of the battery\nV = 6 V .\nNow by Ohm\u2019s law, the current through the circuit is given by\nI=V/Rs\n=6 V/24 \u2126\n=0.25 A.Figure 11.9Figure 11.9Figure 11.9Figure 11.9Figure 11.9  An electric lamp connected in series with\na resistor of 4 \u2126 to a 6 V battery\n2024-25\n\nElectricity 185Applying Ohm\u2019s law to the electric lamp and conductor separately,\nwe get potential difference across the electric lamp,\nV1=20 \u2126 \u00d7 0.25 A\n=5 V;\nand,\nthat acr oss the conductor , V2  =  4 \u2126 \u00d7 0.25 A\n         =  1 V .\nSuppose that we like to replace the series combination of electric\nlamp and conductor by a single and equivalent r esistor . Its resistance\nmust be such that a potential difference of 6 V across the battery\nterminals will cause a current of 0.25 A in the circuit. The resistance\nR of this equivalent resistor would be\nR=V/I\n=6 V/ 0.25 A\n=24 \u2126.\nThis is the total resistance of the series circuit; it is equal to the sum\nof the two resistances.\nQUESTIONS\n?1. Draw a schematic diagram of a circuit consisting of a battery of three\ncells of 2 V each, a 5 \u2126 resistor , an 8 \u2126 resistor , and a 12 \u2126 resistor , and\na plug key, all connected in series.\n2. Redraw the circuit of Question 1, putting in an ammeter to measure\nthe current through the resistors and a voltmeter to measure the\npotential dif ference acr oss the 12 \u2126 resistor . What would be the r eadings\nin the ammeter and the voltmeter?\n11.6.2 Resistors in Parallel\nNow, let us consider the arrangement of three resistors joined in parallel\nwith a combination of cells (or a battery), as shown in Fig.11.7.\nActivity 11.6Activity 11.6Activity 11.6Activity 11.6Activity 11.6\n/square6Make a parallel combination, XY, of three\nresistors having resistances R1, R2, and R3,\nrespectively. Connect it with a battery, a\nplug key and an ammeter , as shown in\nFig. 11.10. Also connect a voltmeter in\nparallel with the combination of resistors.\n/square6Plug the key and note the ammeter reading.\nLet the current be I. Also take the voltmeter\nreading. It gives the potential difference V,\nacross the combination. The potential\ndifference acr oss each r esistor is also V. This\ncan be checked by connecting the voltmeter\nacross each individual resistor (see\nFig. 11.11).Figure 11.10Figure 11.10Figure 11.10Figure 11.10Figure 11.10\n2024-25\n\nScience 186/square6Take out the plug from the key. Remove the ammeter and voltmeter from the circuit.\nInsert the ammeter in series with the resistor R1, as shown in Fig. 11.11. Note the ammeter\nreading, I1.\nFigure 11.11Figure 11.11Figure 11.11Figure 11.11Figure 11.11\n/square6Similarly, measure the currents through R2 and R3. Let these be I2 and I3, respectively.\nWhat is the relationship between I, I1, I2 and I3?\nIt is observed that the total current I , is equal to the sum of the\nseparate currents through each branch of the combination.\nI = I1 + I2 + I3(11.15)\nLet Rp be the equivalent resistance of the parallel combination of\nresistors. By applying Ohm\u2019s law to the parallel combination of resistors,\nwe have\nI = V/Rp(11.16)\nOn applying Ohm\u2019s law to each r esistor , we have\nI1 = V /R1;    I2 = V /R2; and I3 = V /R3(11.17)\nFrom Eqs. (11.15) to (11.17), we have\n  V/Rp = V/R1 + V/R2 + V/R3\nor\n  1/Rp = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3(11.18)\nThus, we may conclude that the reciprocal of the equivalent resistance\nof a group of resistances joined in parallel is equal to the sum of the\nreciprocals of the individual resistances.\nExample 11.8\nIn the circuit diagram given in Fig. 11.10, suppose the resistors R1,\nR2 and R3 have the values 5 \u2126, 10 \u2126, 30 \u2126, respectively, which have\nbeen connected to a battery of 12 V . Calculate (a) the curr ent thr ough\neach r esistor , (b) the total curr ent in the cir cuit, and (c) the total cir cuit\nresistance.\nSolution\nR1 = 5 \u2126, R2 = 10 \u2126, and R3 = 30 \u2126.\nPotential dif ference acr oss the battery, V = 12 V .\nThis is also the potential difference across each of the individual\nresistor; therefore, to calculate the current in the resistors, we use\nOhm\u2019s law.\nThe current  I1, through \nR1 = V/ R1\nI1=12 V/5 \u2126  = 2.4 A.\n2024-25\n\nElectricity 187The current  I2, through R2=V/ R2\nI2=12 V/10 \u2126=1.2 A.\nThe current  I3, through R3=V/R3\nI3=12 V/30 \u2126=0.4 A.\nThe total current in the circuit,\nI= I1 + I2 + I3\n=(2.4 + 1.2 + 0.4) A\n=4 A\nThe total resistance Rp, is given by [Eq. (11.18)]\n1 1 1 1 1\n5 10 30 3pR= + + =\nThus, Rp = 3 \u2126.\nExample 11.9\nIf in Fig. 11.12, R1 = 10 \u2126, R2 = 40 \u2126, R3 = 30 \u2126, R4 = 20 \u2126, R5 = 60 \u2126,\nand a 12 V battery is connected to the arrangement. Calculate\n(a) the total resistance in the circuit, and (b) the total current flowing\nin the circuit.\nSolution\nSuppose we replace the parallel resistors R1 and R2 by an\nequivalent resistor of resistance, R\u2032. Similarly we replace\nthe parallel resistors R3, R4 and R5 by an equivalent single\nresistor of resistance R\u2033. Then using Eq. (11.18), we have\n1/ R\u2032 = 1/10 + 1/40 =5/40; that is R\u2032  = 8 \u2126 .\nSimilarly, 1/ R\u2033=1/30 + 1/20 + 1/60 = 6/60;\nthat is, R\u2033  = 10 \u2126.\nThus, the total resistance, R  = R\u2032 + R\u2033 = 18 \u2126.\nTo calculate the current, we use Ohm\u2019s law, and get\n I = V/R = 12 V/18 \u2126 = 0.67 A.\nWe have seen that in a series cir cuit the curr ent is constant\nthroughout the electric circuit. Thus it is obviously impracticable to\nconnect an electric bulb and an electric heater in series, because they\nneed currents of widely different values to operate properly (see Example\n11.3). Another major disadvantage of a series circuit is that when one\ncomponent fails the circuit is broken and none of the components works.\nIf you have used \u2018fairy lights\u2019 to decorate buildings on festivals, on\nmarriage celebrations etc., you might have seen the electrician spending\nlot of time in trouble-locating and replacing the \u2018dead\u2019 bulb \u2013 each has\nto be tested to find which has fused or gone. On the other hand, a parallel\ncircuit divides the current through the electrical gadgets. The total\nresistance in a parallel circuit is decreased as per Eq. (11.18). This is\nhelpful particularly when each gadget has different resistance and\nrequires different current to operate properly.Figure 11.12Figure 11.12Figure 11.12Figure 11.12Figure 11.12\nAn electric circuit showing\nthe combination of series\nand parallel resistors\n2024-25\n\nScience 18811.7 HEA 11.7 HEA11.7 HEA11.7 HEA11.7 HEA TING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENTTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENTTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENTTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENTTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENT\nWe know that a battery or a cell is a sour ce of electrical ener gy. The\nchemical reaction within the cell generates the potential difference between\nits two terminals that sets the electrons in motion to flow the current\nthrough a r esistor or a system of r esistors connected to the battery. W e\nhave also seen, in Section 11.2, that to maintain the current, the source\nhas to keep expending its energy. Where does this energy go? A part of\nthe source energy in maintaining the current may be consumed into\nuseful work (like in rotating the blades of an electric fan). Rest of the\nsource energy may be expended in heat to raise the temperature of\ngadget. W e often observe this in our everyday life. For example, an electric\nfan becomes warm if used continuously for longer time etc. On the other\nhand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive, that is, a configuration of\nresistors only connected to a battery; the source energy continually gets\ndissipated entirely in the form of heat. This is known as the heating\neffect of electric current. This effect is utilised in devices such as electric\nheater , electric ir on etc.\nConsider a current \nI flowing through a resistor of resistance R . Let\nthe potential difference across it be  V (Fig. 11.13). Let t be the time during\nwhich a charge Q flows across. The work done in moving the charge Q\nthrough a potential difference V is VQ. Therefore, the source must supply\nenergy equal to VQ in time t. Hence the power input to the circuit by the\nsource is\nP V VI =Q\nt= (11.19)\nOr the energy supplied to the circuit by the source in time t  is P \u00d7\n t,\nthat is, VIt. What happens to this energy expended by the source? This\nenergy gets dissipated in the resistor as heat. Thus for a steady\ncurrent  I, the amount of heat H produced in time t is\nH = VIt (11.20)QUESTIONS\n?1.

An electric lamp of 100 \u2126, a toaster of resistance 50 \u2126, and a water\nfilter of resistance 500 \u2126 are connected in parallel to a 220 V source.\nWhat is the resistance of an electric iron connected to the same source\nthat takes as much current as all three appliances, and what is the\ncurrent through it?\n3.

What is (a) the highest, (b) the lowest total resistance that can be secured\nby combinations of four coils of resistance 4 \u2126, 8 \u2126, 12 \u2126, 24 \u2126?\n2024-25\n\nElectricity 189Applying Ohm\u2019s law [Eq. (11.5)], we get\nH = I2 Rt (11.21)\nThis is known as Joule\u2019s law of heating. The\nlaw implies that heat produced in a resistor is\n(i) directly proportional to the square of current\nfor a given  resistance, (ii) directly proportional to\nresistance for a given current, and (iii) directly\nproportional to the time for which the current flows\nthrough the r esistor . In practical situations, when\nan electric appliance is connected to a known\nvoltage source, Eq. (11.21) is used after\ncalculating the current through it, using the\nrelation I = V/R .\nExample 11.10\nAn electric iron consumes energy at a rate of 840 W when heating is\nat the maximum rate and 360 W when the heating is at the minimum.\nThe voltage is 220 V . What ar e the curr ent and the r esistance in each\ncase?\nSolution\nFrom Eq. (11.19), we know that the power input is\nP = V I\nThus the current I = P/V\n(a)When heating is at the maximum rate,\nI = 840 W/220 V = 3.82 A;\nand the resistance of the electric iron is\nR = V/I = 220 V/3.82 A = 57.60 \u2126.\n(b)When heating is at the minimum rate,\nI = 360 W/220 V = 1.64 A;\nand the resistance of the electric iron is\nR = V/I = 220 V/1.64 A = 134.15 \u2126.\nExample 11.11\n100 J of heat is produced each second in a 4 \u2126  resistance. Find the\npotential dif ference acr oss the r esistor .\nSolution\nH = 100 J, R = 4 \u2126, t = 1 s, V = ?\nFrom Eq.

In many cases, it is undesirable as it converts useful\nelectrical energy into heat. In electric circuits, the unavoidable heating\ncan increase the temperature of the components and alter their properties.\nHowever , heating ef fect of electric curr ent has many useful applications.\nThe electric laundry ir on, electric toaster , electric oven, electric kettle\nand electric heater are some of the familiar devices based on Joule\u2019s\nheating.\nThe electric heating is also used to produce light, as in an electric\nbulb. Here, the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is\npossible, so that it gets very hot and emits light. It must not melt at such\nhigh temperature. A strong metal with high melting point such as\ntungsten (melting point 3380\u00b0C) is used for making bulb filaments. The\nfilament should be thermally isolated as much as possible, using\ninsulating support, etc. The bulbs are usually filled with chemically\ninactive nitrogen and argon gases to prolong the life of filament. Most of\nthe power consumed by the filament appears as heat, but a small part\nof it is in the form of light radiated.\nAnother common application of Joule\u2019s heating is the fuse used  in\nelectric circuits. It protects circuits and appliances by stopping the flow\nof any unduly high electric current. The fuse is placed in series with\nthe device. It consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an alloy of\nappropriate melting point, for example aluminium, copper , iron, lead\netc. If a current larger than the specified value flows through the circuit,\nthe temperature of the fuse wire increases. This melts the fuse wire and\nbreaks the circuit. The fuse wire is usually encased in a cartridge of\nporcelain or similar material with metal ends. The fuses used for domestic\npurposes are rated as 1 A, 2 A, 3 A, 5 A, 10 A, etc. For an electric iron\nwhich consumes 1 kW electric power when operated at 220 V, a current\nof (1000/220) A, that is, 4.54 A will flow in the circuit. In this case, a 5 A\nfuse must be used.QUESTIONS\n?1. Why does the cord of an electric heater not glow while the heating element\ndoes?\n2.

This is also the rate of consumption of ener gy.\nEquation (11.21) gives the rate at which electric energy is dissipated\nor consumed in an electric cir cuit. This is also ter med as electric power .\nThe power P is given by\nP  =  VI\nOr P  =  I2R = V2/R (11.22)\nThe SI unit of electric power is watt (W). It is the power consumed by\na device that carries 1 A of current when operated at a potential difference\nof 1 V . Thus,\n       1 W  =  1 volt \u00d7 1 ampere = 1 V A (11.23)\nThe unit \u2018watt\u2019 is very small. Therefore, in actual practice we use a\nmuch larger unit called \u2018kilowatt\u2019. It is equal to 1000 watts. Since electrical\nenergy is the product of power and time, the unit of electric energy is,\ntherefore, watt hour (W h). One watt hour is the energy consumed when\n1 watt of power is used for 1 hour . The commer cial unit of electric ener gy\nis kilowatt hour (kW h), commonly known as \u2018unit\u2019.\n1 kW h =1000 watt \u00d7 3600 second\n=3.6 \u00d7 106 watt second\n=3.6 \u00d7 106 joule (J)More to Know!Many people think that electrons are consumed in an electric circuit.

Determine the power of\nthe motor and the energy consumed in 2 h.\nWhat y ou hav e learnt\n/square6A stream of electrons moving through a conductor constitutes an electric current.\nConventionally, the direction of current is taken opposite to the direction of flow of\nelectrons.\n/square6The SI unit of electric current is ampere.\n/square6To set the electrons in motion in an electric circuit, we use a cell or a battery.

It contr ols\nthe magnitude of the current. The SI unit of resistance is ohm (\u2126 ).\n/square6Ohm\u2019s law: The potential difference across the ends of a resistor is directly\nproportional to the current through it, provided its temperature remains the same.\n/square6The resistance of a conductor depends directly on its length, inversely on its area of\ncross-section, and also on the material of the conductor .\n/square6The equivalent resistance of several resistors in series is equal to the sum of\ntheir individual resistances.\n/square6A set of resistors connected in parallel has an equivalent resistance \nRp given by\n1 2 31 1 1 1...\npR R R R= + + +\n/square6The electrical energy dissipated in a resistor is given by\nW = V \u00d7 I \u00d7 t\n/square6The unit of power is watt (W). One watt of power is consumed when 1 A of current\nflows at a potential dif ference of 1 V .\n/square6The commercial unit of electrical energy is kilowatt hour (kWh).\n1 kW h = 3,600,000 J = 3.6 \u00d7\n 106 J.Solution\nThe total energy consumed by the refrigerator in 30 days would be\n400 W \u00d7 8.0 hour/day \u00d7 30 days = 96000 W h\n= 96 kW h\nThus the cost of energy to operate the refrigerator for 30 days is\n96 kW h \u00d7 Rs 3.00 per kW h = Rs 288.00\n2024-25\n\nElectricity 193EXERCISES\n1.A piece of wire of resistance R  is cut into five equal parts.

W e have alr eady lear nt about physical\nand chemical changes of matter in our previous classes. Whenever a chemical\nchange occurs, we can say that a chemical reaction has taken place.\nYou may per haps be wondering as to what is actually meant by a\nchemical reaction. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction\nhas taken place? Let us perform some activities to find the answer to\nthese questions.\nFigure 1.1\nBurning of a magnesium ribbon in air and collection of magnesium\noxide in a watch-glassActivity 1.1Activity 1.1Activity 1.1Activity 1.1Activity 1.1\nCAUTION:  This Activity needs\nthe teacher\u2019s assistance.

This description of a\nchemical reaction in a sentence form is quite long. It can be written in a\nshorter form. The simplest way to do this is to write it in the form of a\nword-equation.\nThe word-equation for the above reaction would be \u2013\nMagnesium + Oxygen \u2192Magnesium oxide (1.1)\n            (Reactants) (Product)\nThe substances that undergo chemical change in the reaction (1.1),\nmagnesium and oxygen, are the reactants. The new substance is\nmagnesium oxide, formed during the reaction, as a product.\nA word-equation shows change of reactants to products through an\narrow placed between them. The reactants are written on the left-hand\nside (LHS) with a plus sign (+) between them. Similarly, products are\nwritten on the right-hand side (RHS) with a plus sign (+) between them.\nThe arrowhead points towards the products, and shows the direction of\nthe reaction.You must have observed that magnesium ribbon bur ns with a\ndazzling white flame and changes into a white powder . This powder is\nmagnesium oxide. It is formed due to the reaction between magnesium\nand oxygen present in the air .\n2024-25\n\nChemical Reactions and Equations 31.1.1 W riting a Chemical Equation\nIs there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations?\nChemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use\nchemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a\nchemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and\nmagnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as \u2013\nMg + O2  \u2192  MgO (1.2)\nCount and compare the number of atoms of each element on the\nLHS and RHS of the arrow. Is the number of atoms of each element the\nsame on both the sides? If yes, then the equation is balanced. If not,\nthen the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on\nboth sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal\nchemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical\nequation for the bur ning of magnesium in air .\n1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations\nRecall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass\ncan neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the\ntotal mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction\nhas to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants.\nIn other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the\nsame, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a\nskeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us\nlearn about balancing a chemical equation step by step.\nThe word-equation for Activity 1.3 may be represented as \u2013\nZinc + Sulphuric acid  \u2192  Zinc sulphate + Hydrogen\nThe above word-equation may be represented by the following\nchemical equation \u2013\nZn + H2SO4 \u2192 ZnSO4 + H2(1.3)\nLet us examine the number of atoms of different elements on both\nsides of the arrow.\nElement Number of atoms in Number of atoms\nreactants (LHS) in products (RHS)\nZn 1 1\nH 2 2\nS 1 1\nO 4 4\nAs the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of\nthe arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a balanced chemical equation.\nLet us try to balance the following chemical equation \u2013\nFe + H2O \u2192 Fe3O4 + H2(1.4)\n2024-25\n\nScience 4Step I:  To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each\nformula. Do not change anything inside the boxes while balancing the\nequation.\nFe   +   H2O   \u2192   Fe3O4   +   H2(1.5)\nStep II:  List the number of atoms of different elements present in the\nunbalanced equation (1.5).\nElement Number of atoms Number of atoms\nin reactants (LHS) in products (RHS)\nFe 1 3\nH 2 2\nO 1 4\nTo equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we\ncannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the\nreactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient\n\u20184\u2019 as 4 H2O and not H2O4 or (H2O)4. Now the partly balanced equation\nbecome s\u2013\nFe   +   4 H2O   \u2192   Fe3O4   +   H2\nStep IV:  Fe and H atoms ar e still not balanced. Pick any of these elements\nto proceed further . Let us balance hydr ogen atoms in the partly balanced\nequation.\nTo equalise the number of H atoms, make the number of molecules\nof hydrogen as four on the RHS.Step III: It is often convenient to start balancing with the compound\nthat contains the maximum number of atoms. It may be a reactant or a\nproduct. In that compound, select the element which has the maximum\nnumber of atoms. Using these criteria, we select Fe3O4 and the element\noxygen in it. There are four oxygen atoms on the RHS and only one on\nthe LHS.\nTo balance the oxygen atoms \u2013\nThe equation would be \u2013\n  Fe   +   4   H2O   \u2192   Fe3O4   +   4 H2Atoms of In reactants In products\noxygen\n(i)Initial 1 (in H2O) 4 (in Fe3O4)\n(ii)To balance 1\u00d74 4\nAtoms of In reactants In products\nhydrogen\n(i)Initial 8 (in 4 H2O) 2 (in H2)\n(ii)To balance 8 2 \u00d7 4(1.6)\n(partly balanced equation)\n(1.7)\n(partly balanced equation)\n2024-25\n\nChemical Reactions and Equations 5To equalise Fe, we take three atoms of Fe on the LHS.\n3   Fe   +   4   H2O   \u2192   Fe3O4   +   4   H2(1.8)\nStep VI:  Finally, to check the correctness of the balanced equation, we\ncount atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.\n3Fe + 4H2O \u2192 Fe3O4 + 4H2\nThe numbers of atoms of elements on both sides of Eq. (1.9) are\nequal. This equation is now balanced. This method of balancing chemical\nequations is called hit-and-trial method as we make trials to balance\nthe equation by using the smallest whole number coefficient.\nStep VII: Writing Symbols of Physical StatesWriting Symbols of Physical StatesWriting Symbols of Physical StatesWriting Symbols of Physical StatesWriting Symbols of Physical States   Car efully examine\nthe above balanced Eq. (1.9). Does this equation tell us anything about\nthe physical state of each reactant and product? No information has\nbeen given in this equation about their physical states.\nTo make a chemical equation more informative, the physical states\nof the reactants and products are mentioned along with their chemical\nformulae. The gaseous, liquid, aqueous and solid states of reactants\nand products are represented by the notations (g), (l), (aq) and (s),\nrespectively. The word aqueous (aq) is written if the reactant or product\nis present as a solution in water .\nThe balanced Eq. (1.9) becomes\n3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g)  \u2192 Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g) (1.10)\nNote that the symbol (g) is used with H2O to indicate that in this\nreaction water is used in the form of steam.\nUsually physical states are not included in a chemical equation unless\nit is necessary to specify them.\nSometimes the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure,\ncatalyst, etc., for the reaction are indicated above and/or below the arrow\nin the equation. For example \u2013\nCO(g) + 2H (g)2340\natmCH OH(l)3 \uf8e7 \u2192 \uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7 (1.11)\n6CO (aq) 12H O(l) C H O (aq) 6O2 2 6 12 6 + +Sunlight\nChl\norophyll\uf8e7 \u2192 \uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7 \uf8e72 2 2 ( aq) 6H O(l)+ (1.12)\n   (Glucose)\nUsing these steps, can you balance Eq. (1.2) given in the text earlier?Step V:  Examine the above equation and pick up the third element\nwhich is not balanced. Y ou find that only one element is left to be\nbalanced, that is, iron.\nAtoms of In reactants In products\niron\n(i)Initial 1 (in Fe) 3 (in Fe3O4)\n(ii)To balance 1\u00d73 3\n(1.9)\n(balanced equation)\n2024-25\n\nScience 61.2 TYPES OF CHEMIC1.2 TYPES OF CHEMIC1.2 TYPES OF CHEMIC1.2 TYPES OF CHEMIC1.2 TYPES OF CHEMIC AL REAAL REAAL REA\nAL REAAL REA CTIONS CTIONSCTIONS CTIONSCTIONS\nWe have lear nt in Class IX that during a chemical r eaction atoms of one\nelement do not change into those of another element. Nor do atoms\ndisappear from the mixture or appear from elsewhere. Actually, chemical\nreactions involve the breaking and making of bonds between atoms to\nproduce new substances. Y ou will study about types of bonds for med\nbetween atoms in Chapters 3 and 4.\n1.2.1 Combination Reaction\nActivity 1.4Activity 1.4Activity 1.4Activity 1.4Activity 1.4\n/square6Take a small amount of calcium oxide\nor quick lime in a beaker .\n/square6Slowly add water to this.\n/square6Touch the beaker as shown in Fig. 1.3.\n/square6Do you feel any change in temperature?\nFigure 1.3Figure 1.3Figure 1.3Figure 1.3Figure 1.3\nFormation of slaked\nlime by the reaction of\ncalcium oxide with\nwaterCalcium oxide reacts vigorously with water to produce slaked lime\n(calcium hydroxide) releasing a large amount of heat.\nCaO(s) +H2O(l)  \u2192 Ca(OH)2(aq)    +   Heat (1.13)\n(Quick lime)   (Slaked lime)\nIn this reaction, calcium oxide and water combine to form a single\nproduct, calcium hydroxide. Such a reaction in which a single product\nis formed from two or more reactants is known as a combination reaction.QUESTIONS\n1. Why should a magnesium ribbon be cleaned before burning in air?\n2.

Reactions in which heat is\nreleased along with the formation of products are called exothermic\nchemical reactions.\nOther examples of exothermic reactions are \u2013\n(i)Burning of natural gas\nCH4(g) + 2O2 (g) \u2192  CO2 (g) + 2H2O (g) (1.17)\n(ii)Do you know that respiration is an exothermic process?\nWe all know that we need ener gy to stay alive. W e get this ener gy\nfrom the food we eat. During digestion, food is broken down into simpler\nsubstances. For example, rice, potatoes and bread contain\ncarbohydrates. These carbohydrates are broken down to form glucose.\nThis glucose combines with oxygen in the cells of our body and provides\nenergy. The special name of this reaction is respiration, the process of\nwhich you will study in Chapter 6.\nC6H12O6(aq) + 6O2(aq) \u2192 6CO2(aq) + 6H2O(l) + energy (1.18)\n(Glucose)\n(iii) The decomposition of vegetable matter into compost is also an\nexample of an exothermic reaction.\nIdentify the type of the reaction taking place in Activity 1.1, where\nheat is given out along with the formation of a single product.\nDo Y ou Know?A solution of slaked lime produced by the reaction 1.13 is used for whitewashing\nwalls. Calcium hydroxide reacts slowly with the carbon dioxide in air to form a thin\nlayer of calcium carbonate on the walls. Calcium carbonate is  formed after two to\nthree days of whitewashing and gives a shiny finish to the walls. It is interesting to note\nthat the chemical formula for marble is also CaCO3.\nCa(OH)2(aq) + CO2(g) \u2192CaCO3(s)  + H2O(l) (1.14)\n(Calcium (Calcium\nhydroxide) carbonate)\n2024-25\n\nScience 8 88 88Figure 1.5\nHeating of lead nitrate and\nemission of nitrogen dioxide\nFigure 1.4\nCorrect way of heating\nthe boiling tube\ncontaining crystals\nof ferrous sulphate\nand of smelling the\nodour\nActivity 1.6Activity 1.6Activity 1.6Activity 1.6Activity 1.6\nnTake about 2 g lead nitrate powder in a boiling\ntube.\nnHold the boiling tube with a pair of tongs and\nheat it over a flame, as shown in Fig. 1.5.\nnWhat do you observe?

This is a decomposition reaction. Ferrous\nsulphate crystals (FeSO4. 7H2O) lose water when heated and the colour\nof the crystals changes. It then decomposes to ferric oxide (Fe2O3),\nsulphur dioxide (SO2) and sulphur trioxide (SO3). Ferric oxide is a solid,\nwhile SO2 and SO3 are gases.\nDecomposition of calcium carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon\ndioxide on heating is an important decomposition reaction used in\nvarious industries.

This process\nis commonly known as rusting of iron. Some other metals also get\ntarnished in this manner . Have you noticed the colour of the coating\nformed on copper and silver? When a metal is attacked by substances\naround it such as moisture, acids, etc., it is said to corrode and this\nprocess is called corrosion. The black coating on silver and the green\ncoating on copper are other examples of corrosion.\nCorrosion causes damage to car bodies, bridges, iron railings, ships\nand to all objects made of metals, specially those of iron. Corrosion of\niron is a serious problem. Every year an enormous amount of money is\nspent to r eplace damaged ir on. You will lear n mor e about corr osion in\nChapter 3.\n1.3.2 Rancidity\nHave you ever tasted or smelt the fat/oil containing food materials left\nfor a long time?\nWhen fats and oils are oxidised, they become rancid and their smell\nand taste change. Usually substances which prevent oxidation\n(antioxidants) are added to foods containing fats and oil. Keeping food\nin air tight containers helps to slow down oxidation. Do you know that\nchips manufacturers usually flush bags of chips with gas such as\nnitrogen to prevent the chips from getting oxidised ?Recall Activity 1.1Recall Activity 1.1Recall Activity 1.1Recall Activity 1.1Recall Activity 1.1 ,     where a magnesium ribbon burns with a dazzling flame in air (oxygen)\nand changes into a white substance, magnesium oxide.

Y ou also studied the natur\ne, position and relative size of\nimages formed by lenses. How can these ideas help us in the study of\nthe human eye? The human eye uses light and enables us to see objects\naround us. It has a lens in its structure.  What is the function of the lens\nin a human eye? How do the lenses used in spectacles correct defects of\nvision? Let us consider these questions in this chapter .\nWe have lear nt in the pr evious chapter about light and some of its\nproperties. In this chapter , we shall use these ideas to study some of the\noptical phenomena in natur e. We shall also discuss about rainbow\nformation, splitting of white light and blue colour of the sky.\n10.1 THE HUMAN EYE\nThe human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs.\nIt enables us to see the wonderful world and the colours around us. On\nclosing the eyes, we can identify objects to some extent by their smell,\ntaste, sound they make or by touch. It is, however , impossible to identify\ncolours while closing the eyes. Thus, of all the sense organs, the human\neye is the most significant one as it enables us to see the beautiful,\ncolourful world around us.\nThe human eye is like a camera.  Its lens\nsystem forms an image on a light-sensitive\nscreen called the retina. Light enters the eye\nthrough a thin membrane called the cornea.\nIt forms the transparent bulge on the front\nsurface of the eyeball as shown in Fig. 10.1.\nThe eyeball is approximately spherical in shape\nwith a diameter of about 2.3 cm. Most of the\nrefraction for the light rays entering the eye\noccurs at the outer surface of the cornea. The\ncrystalline lens merely provides the finer\nadjustment of focal length required to focus\nobjects at dif ferent distances on the r etina. W e find a structur e called iris\nbehind the cornea. Iris is a dark muscular diaphragm that controls the\nsize of the pupil.  The pupil regulates and controls the amount of light\nFigure 10.1Figure 10.1Figure 10.1Figure 10.1Figure 10.1\nThe human eye\n2024-25\n\nScience 162entering the eye. The eye lens forms an inverted real image of the object\non the retina. The retina is a delicate membrane having enormous\nnumber of light-sensitive cells.  The light-sensitive cells get activated\nupon illumination and generate electrical signals.  These signals are\nsent to the brain via the optic nerves.  The brain interprets these signals,\nand finally, processes the information so that we perceive objects as\nthey are.\n10.1.1 Power of Accommodation\nThe eye lens is composed of a fibrous, jelly-like material. Its curvature\ncan be modified to some extent by the ciliary muscles. The change in the\ncurvature of the eye lens can thus change its focal length. When the\nmuscles are relaxed, the lens becomes thin. Thus, its focal length\nincreases.  This enables us to see distant objects clearly. When you are\nlooking at objects closer to the eye, the ciliary muscles contract. This\nincr\neases the curvatur e of the eye lens. The eye lens then becomes thicker .\nConsequently, the focal length of the eye lens decreases.  This enables\nus to see nearby objects clearly.\nThe ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called\naccommodation.  However , the focal length of the eye lens cannot be\ndecreased below a certain minimum limit.  T ry to r ead a printed page by\nholding it very close to your eyes. Y ou may see the image being blurred\nor feel strain in the eye. To see an object comfortably and distinctly, you\nmust hold it at about 25 cm from the eyes.  The minimum distance, at\nwhich objects can be seen most distinctly without strain, is called the\nleast distance of distinct vision. It is also called the near point of the eye.\nFor a young adult with normal vision, the near point is about\n25 cm. The farthest point upto which the eye can see objects clearly is\ncalled the far point of the eye. It is infinity for a nor mal eye. Y ou may note\nhere a normal eye can see objects clearly that are between 25 cm and\ninfinity.\nSometimes, the crystalline lens of people at old age becomes milky and\ncloudy. This condition is called cataract. This causes partial or complete\nloss of vision. It is possible to restore vision through a cataract surgery.\n10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION\nSometimes, the eye may gradually lose its power of accommodation.\nIn such conditions, the person cannot see the objects distinctly and\ncomfortably. The vision becomes blurred due to the refractive defects\nof the eye.\nThere are mainly three common refractive defects of vision. These\nare (i) myopia or near -sightedness, (ii) Hyper metr opia or far -\nsightedness, and (iii) Presbyopia.  These defects can be corrected by\nthe use of suitable spherical lenses. W e discuss below these defects\nand their correction.\n2024-25\n\nThe Human Eye and the Colour ful W orld 163(a)Myopia\nMyopia is also known as near -\nsightedness. A person with myopia\ncan see nearby objects clearly but\ncannot see distant objects distinctly.\nA person with this defect has the far\npoint nearer than infinity. Such a\nperson may see clearly upto a\ndistance of a few metres. In a myopic\neye, the image of a distant object is\nformed in front of the retina [Fig.\n10.2 (b)] and not at the retina itself.\nThis defect may arise due to (i)\nexcessive curvature of the eye lens,\nor (ii) elongation of the eyeball. This\ndefect can be corrected by using a\nconcave lens of suitable power . This\nis illustrated in Fig. 10.2 (c). A\nconcave lens of suitable power will\nbring the image back on to the\nretina and thus the defect is corrected.\n(b)Hypermetropia\nHyper metropia is also known as far -sightedness.\nA person with hypermetropia can see distant\nobjects clearly but cannot see nearby objects\ndistinctly. The near point, for the person, is farther\naway from the normal near point (25 cm). Such a\nperson has to keep a reading material much\nbeyond 25 cm from the eye for comfortable\nreading. This is because the light rays from a\ncloseby object are focussed at a point behind the\nretina as shown in Fig. 10.3 (b). This defect arises\neither because (i) the focal length of the eye lens is\ntoo long, or (ii) the eyeball has become too small.\nThis defect can be corrected by using a convex\nlens of appr\nopriate power . This is illustrated in\nFig. 10.3 (c). Eye-glasses with converging lenses\nprovide the additional focussing power required\nfor forming the image on the retina.\n(c)   Presbyopia\nThe power of accommodation of the eye usually\ndecreases with ageing. For most people, the near\npoint gradually recedes away. They find it difficult\nto see nearby objects comfortably and distinctly\nwithout corrective eye-glasses.  This defect is\ncalled Presbyopia.  It arises due to the gradualFigure 10.2Figure 10.2Figure 10.2Figure 10.2Figure 10.2\n(a), (b) The myopic eye, and (c) correction for myopia with a\nconcave lens\nFigure 10.3Figure 10.3Figure 10.3Figure 10.3Figure 10.3\n(a), (b) The hypermetropic eye, and (c)\ncorrection for hypermetropia\nN = Near point of a\n      hypermetropic eye.\nN\u2019 = Near point of a\n      normal eye.\n2024-25\n\nScience 164Think it over\nYou talk of wondr ous things you see,\nYou say the sun shines bright;\nI feel him warm, but how can he\nOr make it day or night ?\n \u2013 C. CIBBER\nDo you know that our eyes can live even after our death? By donating our eyes after we\ndie, we can light the life of a blind person.\nAbout 35 million people in the developing world are blind and most of them can be\ncured. About 4.5 million people with corneal blindness can be cured through corneal\ntransplantation of donated eyes. Out of these 4.5 million, 60% are children below the\nage of 12. So, if we have got the gift of vision, why not pass it on to somebody who does\nnot have it? What do we have to keep in mind when eyes have to be donated?\n/square6Eye donors can belong to any age group or sex. People who use spectacles, or those\noperated for cataract, can still donate the eyes. People who are diabetic, have\nhypertension, asthma patients and those without communicable diseases can also\ndonate eyes.weakening of the ciliary muscles and diminishing flexibility of the\neye lens.  Sometimes, a person may suffer from both myopia and\nhypermetropia.  Such people often require bi-focal lenses. A common\ntype of bi-focal lenses consists of both concave and convex lenses.\nThe upper portion consists of a concave lens. It facilitates distant\nvision. The lower part is a convex lens.  It facilitates near vision.\n  These days, it is possible to correct the refractive defects with\ncontact lenses or through surgical interventions.\nQUESTIONS\n?1. What is meant by power of accommodation of the eye?\n2. A person with a myopic eye cannot see objects beyond 1.2 m distinctly.\nWhat should be the type of the corrective lens used to restore proper\nvision?\n3.

For parallel refracting surfaces, as in a glass slab, the emergent ray\nis parallel to the incident ray.  However , it is slightly displaced laterally.\nHow would light get refracted through a transparent prism? Consider a\ntriangular glass prism. It has two triangular bases and three rectangular\nlateral sur faces. These sur faces are inclined to each other . The angle\nbetween its two lateral faces is called the angle of the prism. Let us now\ndo an activity to study the refraction of light through a triangular glass\nprism./square6Eyes must be removed within 4-6 hours after death. Inform the nearest eye bank\nimmediately.\n/square6The eye bank team will remove the eyes at the home of the deceased or at a hospital.\n/square6Eye removal takes only 10-15 minutes. It is a simple process and does not lead to\nany disfigurement.\n/square6Persons who were infected with or died because of AIDS, Hepatitis B or C, rabies,\nacute leukaemia, tetanus, cholera, meningitis or encephalitis cannot donate eyes.\nAn eye bank collects, evaluates and distributes the donated eyes. All eyes donated are\nevaluated using strict medical standards. Those donated eyes found unsuitable for\ntransplantation are used for valuable research and medical education. The identities\nof both the donor and the recipient remain confidential.\nOne pair of eyes gives vision to up to FOUR CORNEAL BLIND PEOPLE.\nActivity 10.1Activity 10.1Activity 10.1Activity 10.1Activity 10.1\n/square6Fix a sheet of white paper on a drawing board using drawing pins.\n/square6Place a glass prism on it in such a way that it rests on its triangular\nbase. Trace the outline of the prism using a pencil.\n/square6Draw a straight line PE inclined to one of the refracting surfaces,\nsay AB, of the prism.\n/square6Fix two pins, say at points P and Q, on the line PE as shown in\nFig. 10.4.\n/square6Look for the images of the pins, fixed at P and Q, through the\nother face AC.\n/square6Fix two more pins, at points R and S, such that the pins at R and\nS and the images of the pins at P and Q lie on the same straight\nline.\n/square6Remove the pins and the glass prism.\n/square6The line PE meets the boundary of the prism at point E\n(see Fig. 10.4). Similarly, join and produce the points R and S.  Let\nthese lines meet the boundary of the prism at E and F , respectively.\nJoin E and F .\n/square6Draw perpendiculars to the refracting surfaces AB and AC of the\nprism at points E and F , respectively.\n/square6Mark the angle of incidence ( \u2220i), the angle of refraction ( \u2220r) and\nthe angle of emergence ( \u2220e) as shown in Fig. 10.4.\n2024-25\n\nScience 166Activity 10.2Activity 10.2Activity 10.2Activity 10.2Activity 10.2\n/square6Take a thick sheet of cardboard and make a small hole or narrow\nslit in its middle.\n/square6Allow sunlight to fall on the narrow slit. This gives a narrow beam\nof white light.\n/square6Now, take a glass prism and allow the light from the slit to fall on\none of its faces as shown in Fig. 10.5.\n/square6Turn the prism slowly until the light that comes out of it appears\non a nearby screen.\n/square6What do you observe? Y ou will find a beautiful band of colours.\nWhy does this happen?Here PE is the incident ray, EF is the refracted ray and FS is the\nemergent ray. Y ou may note that a ray of light is entering fr\nom air to\nglass at the first surface AB. The light ray on refraction has bent towards\nthe normal. At the second surface AC, the light ray has entered from\nglass to air . Hence it has bent away fr om nor mal. Compar e the angle of\nincidence and the angle of refraction at each refracting surface of the\nprism. Is this similar to the kind of bending that occurs in a glass slab?\nThe peculiar shape of the prism makes the emergent ray bend at an\nangle to the direction of the incident ray. This angle is called the angle of\ndeviation. In this case \u2220 D is the angle of deviation.

Before we take up this question, we shall first go back to the\nrefraction of light through a prism. The inclined refracting surfaces of a\nglass prism show exciting phenomenon.  Let us find it out through an\nactivity.PE \u2013 Incident ray \u2220i \u2013 Angle of incidence\nEF \u2013 Refracted ray \u2220r \u2013 Angle of refraction\nFS \u2013 Emergent ray \u2220e \u2013 Angle of emergence\n\u2220A \u2013 Angle of the prism \u2220D \u2013 Angle of deviation\nFigure 10.4Figure 10.4Figure 10.4Figure 10.4Figure 10.4  Refraction of light through a triangular glass prism\n2024-25\n\nThe Human Eye and the Colour ful W orld 167The prism has probably split the incident\nwhite light into a band of colours.  Note the\ncolours that appear at the two ends of the\ncolour band. What is the sequence of colours\nthat you see on the screen? The various\ncolours seen are Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green,\nYellow, Orange and Red, as shown in\nFig. 10.5. The acronym VIBGYOR will help\nyou to remember the sequence of colours.\nThe band of the coloured components of a\nlight beam is called its spectrum. Y ou might\nnot be able to see all the colours separately.\nYet something makes each colour distinct fr om the other . The splitting\nof light into its component colours is called dispersion.\nYou have seen that white light is dispersed\ninto its seven-colour components by a prism.\nWhy do we get these colours? Different colours\nof light bend through different angles with\nrespect to the incident ray, as they pass\nthrough a prism. The red light bends the least\nwhile the violet the most. Thus the rays of each\ncolour emerge along different paths and thus\nbecome distinct. It is the band of distinct\ncolours that we see in a spectrum.\nIsaac Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain\nthe spectrum of sunlight. He tried to split the colours of\nthe spectrum of white light further by using another similar\nprism. However , he could not get any mor e colours. He\nthen placed a second identical prism in an inverted position\nwith respect to the first prism, as shown in Fig. 10.6. This\nallowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass through\nthe second prism. He found a beam of white light emerging\nfrom the other side of the second prism. This observation\ngave Newton the idea that the sunlight is made up of seven\ncolours.\nAny light that gives a spectrum similar to that of\nsunlight is often referred to as white light.\nA rainbow is a natural spectrum appearing in the sky\nafter a rain shower (Fig. 10.7). It is caused by dispersion\nof sunlight by tiny water droplets, present in the\natmosphere. A rainbow is always formed in a direction\nopposite to that of the Sun. The water droplets act like\nsmall prisms. They refract and disperse the incident\nsunlight, then reflect it internally, and finally refract it\nagain when it comes out of the raindrop (Fig. 10.8). Due\nto the dispersion of light and internal reflection, different\ncolours reach the observer\u2019s eye.\nYou can also see a rainbow on a sunny day when\nyou look at the sky through a waterfall or through a water\nfountain, with the Sun behind you.Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Dispersion of white light by the glass prism\nFigure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Recombination of the spectrum of\nwhite light\nFigure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Rainbow in the sky\nFigure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Rainbow formationSunlightRaindrop\n2024-25\n\nScience 168Figure 10.10Figure 10.10Figure 10.10Figure 10.10Figure 10.10\nAtmospheric refraction\neffects at sunrise and\nsunset10.5     ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION\nYou might have observed the apparent random wavering or\nflickering of objects seen through a turbulent stream of hot air\nrising above a fir e or a radiator . The air just above the fir e becomes\nhotter than the air further up. The hotter air is lighter (less dense)\nthan the cooler air above it, and has a refractive index slightly\nless than that of the cooler air . Since the physical conditions of\nthe refracting medium (air) are not stationary, the apparent\nposition of the object, as seen thr ough the hot air , fluctuates.\nThis wavering is thus an effect of atmospheric refraction (refraction\nof light by the earth\u2019s atmosphere) on a small scale in our local\nenvironment. The twinkling of stars is a similar phenomenon on\na much larger scale. Let us see how we can explain it.\nTwinkling of stars\nThe twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight. The\nstarlight, on entering the earth\u2019s atmosphere, undergoes refraction\ncontinuously before it reaches the earth. The atmospheric refraction\noccurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index. Since the\natmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent position\nof the star is slightly different from its actual position. The star appears\nslightly higher (above) than its actual position when viewed near the\nhorizon (Fig. 10.9). Further , this apparent position of the star is not\nstationary, but keeps on changing slightly, since the physical conditions\nof the earth\u2019s atmosphere are not stationary, as was the case in the\nprevious paragraph. Since the stars are very distant, they approximate\npoint-sized sources of light. As the path of rays of light coming from\nthe star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the star\nfluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers \u2013 the\nstar sometimes appears brighter , and at some other time, fainter , which\nis the twinkling effect.\nWhy don\u2019t the planets twinkle? The p lanets are much\ncloser to the earth, and are thus seen as extended sources.\nIf we consider a planet as a collection of a large number\nof point-sized sources of light, the total variation in the\namount of light entering our eye from all the individual\npoint-sized sources will average out to zero, thereby\nnullifying the twinkling effect.\nAdvance sunrise and delayed sunset\nThe Sun is visible to us about 2 minutes before the actual\nsunrise, and about 2 minutes after the actual sunset\nbecause of atmospheric refraction. By actual sunrise, we\nmean the actual crossing of the horizon by the Sun. Fig.\n10.10 shows the actual and apparent positions of the\nSun with respect to the horizon. The time difference\nbetween actual sunset and the apparent sunset is about\n2 minutes. The apparent flattening of the Sun\u2019s disc at\nsunrise and sunset is also due to the same phenomenon .Figure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9\nApparent star position\ndue to atmospheric\nrefraction\n2024-25\n\nThe Human Eye and the Colour ful W orld 16910.6  SC ATTERING OF LIGHT\nThe interplay of light with objects around us gives rise to several\nspectacular phenomena in nature. The blue colour of the sky, colour of\nwater in deep sea, the reddening of the sun at sunrise and the sunset\nare some of the wonderful phenomena we are familiar with. In the previous\nclass, you have learnt about the scattering of light by colloidal particles.\nThe path of a beam of light passing through a true solution is not visible.\nHowever , its path becomes visible thr ough a colloidal solution wher e the\nsize of the particles is r elatively lar ger.\n10.6.1 T yndall Effect\nThe earth\u2019s atmosphere is a heterogeneous mixture of minute particles.\nThese particles include smoke, tiny water droplets, suspended particles\nof dust and molecules of air . When a beam of light strikes such fine\nparticles, the path of the beam becomes visible. The light reaches us,\nafter being reflected diffusely by these particles. The phenomenon of\nscattering of light by the colloidal particles gives rise to Tyndall effect\nwhich you have studied in Class IX. This phenomenon is seen when a\nfine beam of sunlight enters a smoke-filled room through a small hole.\nThus, scattering of light makes the particles visible. Tyndall effect can\nalso be observed when sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense\nforest.  Here, tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light.\nThe colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering\nparticles. V ery fine particles scatter mainly blue light while particles of\nlarger size scatter light of longer wavelengths.  If the size of the scattering\nparticles is large enough, then, the scattered light may even appear\nwhite.\n10.6.2 Why is the colour of the clear Sky Blue?\nThe molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size\nsmaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are more effective in\nscattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer\nwavelengths at the red end. The red light has a wavelength about 1.8\ntimes greater than blue light. Thus, when sunlight passes through the\natmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter\nwavelengths) more strongly than red. The scattered blue light enters\nour eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been\nany scattering. Then, the sky would have looked dark.  The sky appears\ndark to passengers flying at very high altitudes, as scattering is not\nprominent at such heights.\nYou might have observed that \u2018danger\u2019 signal lights ar e red in colour .\nDo you know why? The red is least scattered by fog or smoke.  Therefore,\nit can be seen in the same colour at a distance.\n2024-25\n\nScience 170What y ou hav e learnt\n/square6The ability of the eye to focus on both near and distant objects, by adjusting its\nfocal length, is called the accommodation of the eye.\n/square6The smallest distance, at which the eye can see objects clearly without strain, is\ncalled the near point of the eye or the least distance of distinct vision.  For a young\nadult with normal vision, it is about 25 cm.\n/square6The common refractive defects of vision include myopia, hypermetropia and\npresbyopia. Myopia (short-sightedness \u2013 the image of distant objects is focussed\nbefor e the r etina) is corr ected by using a concave lens of suitable power .\nHyper metropia (far -sightedness \u2013 the image of nearby objects is focussed beyond\nthe retina) is corr\nected by using a convex lens of suitable power . The eye loses its\npower of accommodation at old age.\n/square6The splitting of white light into its component colours is called dispersion.\n/square6Scattering of light causes the blue colour of sky.\nEXERCISES\n1.The human eye can focus on objects at different distances by adjusting the focal\nlength of the eye lens.

            "text": "How do Organisms\nReproduce ?7 CHAPTER\nBefore we discuss the mechanisms by which organisms reproduce,\nlet us ask a more basic question \u2013 why do organisms reproduce?\nAfter all, reproduction is not necessary to maintain the life of an individual\norganism, unlike the essential life processes such as nutrition,\nrespiration, or excretion. On the other hand, if an individual organism is\ngoing to create more individuals, a lot of its energy will be spent in the\nprocess. So why should an individual organism waste energy on a process\nit does not need to stay alive? It would be interesting to discuss the\npossible answers in the classroom!\nWhatever the answer to this question, it is obvious that we notice\norganisms because they reproduce. If there were to be only one, non-\nreproducing member of a particular kind, it is doubtful that we would\nhave noticed its existence. It is the large numbers of organisms belonging\nto a single species that bring them to our notice. How do we know that\ntwo different individual organisms belong to the same species? Usually,\nwe say this because they look similar to each other . Thus, r eproducing\norganisms create new individuals that look very much like themselves.\n7.1 DO ORG7.1 DO ORG7.1 DO ORG7.1 DO ORG7.1 DO ORG ANISMS CREAANISMS CREAANISMS CREAANISMS CREAANISMS CREA TE EXATE EXATE EXA\nTE EXATE EXA CT COPIES OFCT COPIES OFCT COPIES OFCT COPIES OFCT COPIES OF\nTHEMSEL THEMSELTHEMSEL THEMSELTHEMSEL VES? VES?VES? VES?VES?\nOrganisms look similar because their body designs are similar . If body\ndesigns are to be similar , the blueprints for these designs should be\nsimilar . Thus, repr oduction at its most basic level will involve making\ncopies of the blueprints of body design. In Class IX, we learnt that the\nchromosomes in the nucleus of a cell contain information for inheritance\nof features from parents to next generation in the form of DNA (Deoxyribo\nNucleic Acid) molecules. The DNA in the cell nucleus is the information\nsource for making proteins. If the information is changed, different\nproteins will be made. Different proteins will eventually lead to altered\nbody designs.\nTherefore, a basic event in reproduction is the creation of a DNA\ncopy. Cells use chemical reactions to build copies of their DNA. This\ncreates two copies of the DNA in a reproducing cell, and they will need to\nbe separated fr om each other . However , keeping one copy of DNA in the\noriginal cell and simply pushing the other one out would not work,\n2024-25\n\nScience 114?because the copy pushed out would not have any organised cellular\nstructure for maintaining life processes. Therefore, DNA copying is\naccompanied by the creation of an additional cellular apparatus, and\nthen the DNA copies separate, each with its own cellular apparatus.\nEffectively, a cell divides to give rise to two cells.\nThese two cells ar e of course similar , but ar e they likely to be\nabsolutely identical? The answer to this question will depend on how\naccurately the copying r eactions involved occur . No bio-chemical r eaction\nis absolutely reliable. Therefore, it is only to be expected that the process\nof copying the DNA will have some variations each time. As a result, the\nDNA copies generated will be similar , but may not be identical to the\noriginal. Some of these variations might be so drastic that the new DNA\ncopy cannot work with the cellular apparatus it inherits. Such a newborn\ncell will simply die. On the other hand, there could still be many other\nvariations in the DNA copies that would not lead to such a drastic\noutcome. Thus, the surviving cells are similar to, but subtly different\nfrom each other . This inbuilt tendency for variation during r eproduction\nis the basis for evolution, as we will discuss in the next chapter .\n7.1.1 The Impor tance of V ariation\nPopulations of organisms fill well-defined places, or niches, in the\necosystem, using their ability to reproduce. The consistency of DNA\ncopying during reproduction is important for the maintenance of body\ndesign features that allow the organism to use that particular niche.\nReproduction is therefore linked to the stability of populations of species.\nHowever , niches can change because of r easons beyond the contr ol\nof the organisms. Temperatures on earth can go up or down, water levels\ncan vary, or there could be meteorite hits, to think of a few examples. If\na population of reproducing organisms were suited to a particular niche\nand if the niche were drastically altered, the population could be wiped\nout. However , if some variations wer e to be pr esent in a few individuals\nin these populations, there would be some chance for them to survive.\nThus, if there were a population of bacteria living in temperate waters,\nand if the water temperature were to be increased by global warming,\nmost of these bacteria would die, but the few variants resistant to heat\nwould survive and gr ow further . Variation is thus useful for the survival\nof species over time.\nQUESTIONS\n1. What is the importance of DNA copying in reproduction?\n2. Why is variation beneficial to the species but not necessarily\nfor the individual?\n2024-25\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce? 115\nFigure 7.1(a)Figure 7.1(a)Figure 7.1(a)Figure 7.1(a)Figure 7.1(a)  Binary fission in AmoebaActivity 7.2Activity 7.2Activity 7.2Activity 7.2Activity 7.27.2 MODES OF REPRODUCTION USED BY SINGLE7.2 MODES OF REPRODUCTION USED BY SINGLE7.2 MODES OF REPRODUCTION USED BY SINGLE7.2 MODES OF REPRODUCTION USED BY SINGLE7.2 MODES OF REPRODUCTION USED BY SINGLE\nORGANISMSORGANISMSORGANISMSORGANISMSORGANISMS\nActivity 7.1Activity 7.1Activity 7.1Activity 7.1Activity 7.1\n/square6Dissolve about 10 gm of sugar in 100 mL of water .\n/square6Take 20 mL of this solution in a test tube and add a pinch of yeast\ngranules to it.\n/square6Put a cotton plug on the mouth of the test tube and keep it in a\nwarm place.\n/square6After 1 or 2 hours, put a small drop of yeast culture from the test\ntube on a slide and cover it with a coverslip.\n/square6Observe the slide under a microscope.\n/square6Wet a slice of br ead, and keep it in a cool, moist and dark place.\n/square6Observe the surface of the slice with a magnifying glass.\n/square6Record your observations for a week.\nCompare and contrast the ways in which yeast grows in the first\ncase, and how mould grows in the second.\nHaving discussed the context in which reproductive processes work,\nlet us now examine how different organisms actually reproduce. The\nmodes by which various organisms reproduce depend on the body\ndesign of the organisms.\n7.2.1 Fission\nFor unicellular organisms, cell division, or fission, leads to the creation\nof new individuals. Many different patterns of fission have been observed.\nMany bacteria and protozoa simply split into two equal halves during\ncell division. In organisms such as Amoeba , the splitting of the two cells\nduring division can take place in any plane.\nActivity 7.3Activity 7.3Activity 7.3Activity 7.3Activity 7.3\n/square6Observe a permanent slide of\nAmoeba  under a microscope.\n/square6Similarly observe another\npermanent slide of Amoeba\nshowing binary fission.\n/square6Now, compare the observations of\nboth the slides.\nHowever , some unicellular or ganisms\nshow somewhat more organisation of their\nbodies, such as is seen in Leishmania  (which\ncause kala-azar ), which have a whip-like\nstructure at one end of the cell. In such\norganisms, binary fission occurs in a definite orientation in relation toFigure 7.1(b)Figure 7.1(b)Figure 7.1(b)Figure 7.1(b)Figure 7.1(b)  Binary fission in Leishmania  (a)         (b)          (c)          (d)            (e)                        (f)\n2024-25\n\nScience 116these structures. Other single-celled organisms, such as the malarial\nparasite, Plasmodium , divide into many daughter cells simultaneously\nby multiple fission.\nYeast, on the other hand, can put out small buds that separate and\ngrow further , as we saw in Activity 7.1.\n7.2.2 Fragmentation\nFigure 7.2Figure 7.2Figure 7.2Figure 7.2Figure 7.2\nMultiple fission in\nPlasmodium Activity 7.4Activity 7.4Activity 7.4Activity 7.4Activity 7.4\n/square6Collect water from a lake or pond that appears dark green and\ncontains filamentous structures.\n/square6Put one or two filaments on a slide.\n/square6Put a drop of glycerine on these filaments and cover it with a coverslip.\n/square6Observe the slide under a microscope.\n/square6Can you identify different tissues in the Spirogyra  filaments?\nIn multi-cellular organisms with relatively simple body organisation,\nsimple reproductive methods can still work. Spirogyra , for example,\nsimply breaks up into smaller pieces upon maturation. These pieces or\nfragments grow into new individuals. Can we work out the reason for\nthis, based on what we saw in Activity 7.4?\nThis is not true for all multi-cellular organisms. They cannot simply\ndivide cell-by-cell. The reason is that many multi-cellular organisms, as\nwe have seen, are not simply a random collection of cells. Specialised\ncells are organised as tissues, and tissues are organised into organs,\nwhich then have to be placed at definite positions in the body. In such a\ncarefully organised situation, cell-by-cell division would be impractical.\nMulti-cellular organisms, therefore, need to use more complex ways of\nreproduction.\nA basic strategy used in multi-cellular organisms is that different\ncell types perform different specialised functions. Following this general\npattern, reproduction in such organisms is also the function of a specific\ncell type. How is reproduction to be achieved from a single cell type, if\nthe organism itself consists of many cell types? The answer is that there\nmust be a single cell type in the organism that is capable of growing,\nproliferating and making other cell types under the right circumstances.\n7.2.3 Regeneration\nMany fully differentiated organisms have the ability to give rise to new\nindividual organisms from their body parts. That is, if the individual is\nsomehow cut or broken up into many pieces, many of these pieces grow\ninto separate individuals. For example, simple animals like Hydra  and\nPlanaria  can be cut into any number of pieces and each piece grows\ninto a complete organism. This is known as regeneration (see Fig. 7.3).\nRegeneration is carried out by specialised cells. These cells proliferate\nand make large numbers of cells. From this mass of cells, different cells\nundergo changes to become various cell types and tissues. These changes\n2024-25\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce? 117\nFigure 7.3 Figure 7.3 Figure 7.3 Figure 7.3 Figure 7.3 Regeneration in Planariatake place in an organised\nsequence referred to as\ndevelopment. However ,\nregeneration is not the same\nas reproduction, since most\norganisms would not\nnormally depend on being cut\nup to be able to reproduce.\n7.2.4 Budding\nOrganisms such as Hydra\nuse regenerative cells for\nreproduction in the process of\nbudding. In Hydra , a bud\ndevelops as an outgrowth due\nto repeated cell division at one\nspecific site (Fig. 7.4). These buds develop into tiny individuals and when\nfully mature, detach from the parent body and become new independent\nindividuals.\nFigure 7.4Figure 7.4Figure 7.4Figure 7.4Figure 7.4  Budding in Hydra\n7.2.5 V egetative Propagation\nThere are many plants in which parts like the root, stem and leaves\ndevelop into new plants under appropriate conditions. Unlike in most\nanimals, plants can indeed use such a mode for reproduction. This\nproperty of vegetative propagation is used in methods such as layering\nor grafting to grow many plants like sugarcane, roses, or grapes for\nagricultural purposes. Plants raised by vegetative propagation can bear\nflowers and fruits earlier than those produced from seeds. Such methods\nalso make possible the propagation of plants such as banana, orange,\nrose and jasmine that have lost the capacity to produce seeds. Another\nadvantage of vegetative propagation is that all plants produced are\ngenetically similar enough to the parent plant to have all its\ncharacteristics.\n2024-25\n\nScience 118Similarly buds produced in the notches along the leaf\nmargin of Bryophyllum  fall on the soil and develop into\nnew plants (Fig. 7.5).\nActivity 7.6Activity 7.6Activity 7.6Activity 7.6Activity 7.6\n/square6Select a money-plant.\n/square6Cut some pieces such that they contain at least\none leaf.\n/square6Cut out some other portions between two leaves.\n/square6Dip one end of all the pieces in water and observe\nover the next few days.\n/square6Which ones grow and give rise to fresh leaves?\n/square6What can you conclude from your observations?\nTissue cultur e\nIn tissue culture, new plants are grown by removing tissue or separating cells from\nthe growing tip of a plant. The cells are then placed in an artificial medium where they\ndivide rapidly to form a small group of cells or callus. The callus is transferred to\nanother medium containing hormones for growth and differentiation. The plantlets\nare then placed in the soil so that they can grow into mature plants. Using tissue\nculture, many plants can be grown from one parent in disease-free conditions. This\ntechnique is commonly used for ornamental plants.\n7.2.6 Spore F ormation\nEven in many simple multi-cellular organisms, specific reproductive\nparts can be identified. The thread-like structures that developed on\nthe bread in Activity 7.2 above are the hyphae of the bread mould\n(Rhizopus ). They are not reproductive parts. On the other hand, the\ntiny blob-on-a-stick structures are involved in reproduction. The\nblobs are sporangia, which contain cells, or spores, that can\neventually develop into new Rhizopus  individuals (Fig. 7.6). The spores\nare covered by thick walls that protect them until they come into\ncontact with another moist surface and can begin to grow.Figure 7.6Figure 7.6Figure 7.6Figure 7.6Figure 7.6\nSpore formation in RhizopusActivity 7.5Activity 7.5Activity 7.5Activity 7.5Activity 7.5\n/square6Take a potato and observe its surface.

This is known as\nasexual reproduction.\nQUESTIONS\n?1. How does binary fission differ from multiple fission?\n2. How will an organism be benefited if it reproduces through spores?\n3. Can you think of reasons why more complex organisms cannot give\nrise to new individuals through regeneration?\n4. Why is vegetative propagation practised for growing some types of\nplants?\n5. Why is DNA copying an essential part of the process of reproduction?\n7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION\nWe are also familiar with modes of r eproduction that depend on the\ninvolvement of two individuals before a new generation can be created.\nBulls alone cannot produce new calves, nor can hens alone produce\nnew chicks. In such cases, both sexes, males and females, are needed to\nproduce new generations. What is the significance of this sexual mode\nof reproduction? Are there any limitations of the asexual mode of\nreproduction, which we have been discussing above?\n7.3.1 Why the Sexual Mode of Reproduction?\nThe creation of two new cells from one involves copying of the DNA as\nwell as of the cellular apparatus. The DNA copying mechanism, as we\nhave noted, cannot be absolutely accurate, and the resultant errors are\na source of variations in populations of organisms. Every individual\norganism cannot be protected by variations, but in a population,\nvariations are useful for ensuring the survival of the species. It would\ntherefore make sense if organisms came up with reproductive modes\nthat allowed more and more variation to be generated.\nWhile DNA-copying mechanisms are not absolutely accurate, they\nare precise enough to make the generation of variation a fairly slow\nprocess. If the DNA copying mechanisms were to be less accurate, many\nof the resultant DNA copies would not be able to work with the cellular\napparatus, and would die. So how can the process of making variants\nbe speeded up? Each new variation is made in a DNA copy that already\nhas variations accumulated from previous generations. Thus, two\ndifferent individuals in a population would have quite different patterns\nof accumulated variations. Since all of these variations are in living\nindividuals, it is assured that they do not have any really bad effects.\nCombining variations from two or more individuals would thus create\nnew combinations of variants. Each combination would be novel, since\nit would involve two different individuals. The sexual mode of\n2024-25\n\nScience 120reproduction incorporates such a process of combining DNA from two\ndifferent individuals during reproduction.\nBut this creates a major difficulty. If each new generation is to be the\ncombination of the DNA copies from two pre-existing individuals, then\neach new generation will end up having twice the amount of DNA that\nthe previous generation had. This is likely to mess up the control of the\ncellular apparatus by the DNA. How many ways can we think of for\nsolving this difficulty?\nWe have seen earlier that as or ganisms become mor\ne complex, the\nspecialisation of tissue increases. One solution that many multi-cellular\norganisms have found for the problem mentioned above is to have special\nlineages of cells in specialised organs in which only half the number of\nchromosomes and half the amount of DNA as compared to the non-\nreproductive body cells. This is achieved by a process of cell division\ncalled meiosis. Thus, when these germ-cells from two individuals combine\nduring sexual reproduction to form a new individual, it results in re-\nestablishment of the number of chromosomes and the DNA content in\nthe new generation.\nIf the zygote is to grow and develop into an organism which has\nhighly specialised tissues and organs, then it has to have sufficient stores\nof energy for doing this. In very simple organisms, it is seen that the two\ngerm-cells ar e not very dif ferent fr om one another , or may even be similar .\nBut as the body designs become more complex, the germ-cells also\nspecialise. One germ-cell is large and contains the food-stores while the\nother is smaller and likely to be motile. Conventionally, the motile germ-\ncell is called the male gamete and the germ-cell containing the stored\nfood is called the female gamete. W e shall see in the next few sections\nhow the need to create these two different types of gametes give rise to\ndifferences in the male and female reproductive organs and, in some\ncases, differences in the bodies of the male and female organisms.\n7.3.2 Sexual Reproduction in Flowering Plants\nThe r eproductive parts of angiosper ms ar e located in the flower . You\nhave already studied the different parts of a flower \u2013 sepals, petals,\nstamens and pistil. Stamens and pistil are\nthe reproductive parts of a flower which\ncontain the germ-cells.  What possible\nfunctions could the petals and sepals serve?\nThe flower may be unisexual (papaya,\nwatermelon) when it contains either stamens\nor pistil or bisexual ( Hibiscus , mustard)\nwhen it contains both stamens and pistil.\nStamen is the male reproductive part and it\nproduces pollen grains that are yellowish\nin colour . You must have seen this yellowish\npowder that often sticks to our hands if we\ntouch the stamen of a flower . Pistil is pr esent\nin the centre of a flower and is the female\nreproductive part. It is made of three parts.\nFigure 7.7Figure 7.7Figure 7.7Figure 7.7Figure 7.7\nLongitudinal section of\nflower\n2024-25\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce? 121\nFigure 7.8Figure 7.8Figure 7.8Figure 7.8Figure 7.8\nGermination of pollen on\nstigmaThe swollen bottom part is the ovary, middle elongated part is the style\nand the terminal part which may be sticky is the stigma. The ovary\ncontains ovules and each ovule has an egg cell. The male germ-cell\nproduced by pollen grain fuses with the female gamete present in\nthe ovule. This fusion of the germ-cells or fertilisation gives us the\nzygote which is capable of growing into a new plant.\nThus the pollen needs to be transferred from the stamen to the\nstigma. If this transfer of pollen occurs in the same flower , it is\nreferred to as self-pollination. On the other hand, if the pollen is\ntransferr ed fr om one flower to another , it is known as cr oss-\npollination. This transfer of pollen from one flower to another is\nachieved by agents like wind, water or animals.\nAfter the pollen lands on a suitable stigma, it has to reach the\nfemale germ-cells which are in the ovary. For this, a tube grows\nout of the pollen grain and travels through the style to reach the\novary.\nAfter fertilisation, the zygote divides several times to form an\nembryo within the ovule. The ovule develops a tough coat and is\ngradually converted into a seed. The ovary grows rapidly and ripens\nto form a fruit. Meanwhile, the petals, sepals, stamens, style and\nstigma may shrivel and fall off. Have you ever observed any flower\npart still persisting in the fruit? T ry and work out the advantages\nof seed-formation for the plant. The seed contains the future plant\nor embryo which develops into a seedling under appropriate\nconditions. This process is known as germination.\nActivity 7.7Activity 7.7Activity 7.7Activity 7.7Activity 7.7\n/square6Soak a few seeds of Bengal gram ( chana )\nand keep them overnight.\n/square6Drain the excess water and cover the seeds\nwith a wet cloth and leave them for a day.\nMake sure that the seeds do not become dry.\n/square6Cut open the seeds carefully and observe\nthe different parts.\n/square6Compare your observations with the Fig. 7.9\nand see if you can identify all the parts.\n7.3.3 Reproduction in Human Beings\nSo far , we have been discussing the variety of modes that dif ferent species\nuse for reproduction. Let us now look at the species that we are most\ninterested in, namely, humans. Humans use a sexual mode of\nreproduction. How does this process work?\nLet us begin at an apparently unrelated point. All of us know that\nour bodies change as we become older . You have lear nt changes that\ntake place in your body earlier in Class VIII also. W e notice that our\nheight has incr eased continuously fr\nom early age till now. W e acquir e\nteeth, we even lose the old, so-called milk teeth and acquire new ones.\nFigure 7.9Figure 7.9Figure 7.9Figure 7.9Figure 7.9\nGermination\n2024-25\n\nScience 122All of these are changes that can be grouped under the general process\nof growth, in which the body becomes lar ger. But in early teenage years,\na whole new set of changes occurs that cannot be explained simply as\nbody enlargement. Instead, the appearance of the body changes.\nProportions change, new featur es appear , and so do new sensations.\nSome of these changes ar e common to both boys and girls. W e begin\nto notice thick hair growing in new parts of the body such as armpits\nand the genital area between the thighs, which can also become darker\nin colour . Thinner hair can also appear on legs and ar ms, as well as on\nthe face. The skin frequently becomes oily and we might begin to develop\npimples. W e begin to be conscious and awar e of both our own bodies\nand those of others in new ways.\nOn the other hand, there are also changes taking place that are\ndifferent between boys and girls. In girls, breast size begins to increase,\nwith darkening of the skin of the nipples at the tips of the breasts. Also,\ngirls begin to menstruate at around this time. Boys begin to have new\nthick hair gr owth on the face and their voices begin to crack. Further ,\nthe penis occasionally begins to become enlarged and erect, either in\ndaydreams or at night.\nAll of these changes take place slowly, over a period of months and\nyears. They do not happen all at the same time in one person, nor do\nthey happen at an exact age. In some people, they happen early and\nquickly, while in others, they can happen slowly. Also, each change does\nnot become complete quickly either . So, for example, thick hair on the\nface in boys appears as a few scattered hairs first, and only slowly does\nthe growth begin to become uniform. Even so, all these changes show\ndifferences between people. Just as we have differently shaped noses or\nfingers, so also we have different patterns of hair growth, or size and\nshape of breast or penis. All of these changes are aspects of the sexual\nmaturation of the body.\nWhy does the body show sexual maturation at this age? W e have\ntalked about the need for specialised cell types in multi-cellular bodies\nto carry out specialised functions. The creation of germ-cells to participate\nin sexual reproduction is another specialised function, and we have seen\nthat plants develop special cell and tissue types to create them. Human\nbeings also develop special tissues for this purpose. However , while the\nbody of the individual organism is growing to its adult size, the resources\nof the body are mainly directed at achieving this growth. While that is\nhappening, the maturation of the reproductive tissue is not likely to be\na major priority. Thus, as the rate of general body growth begins to slow\ndown, reproductive tissues begin to mature. This period during\nadolescence is called puberty.\nSo how do all the changes that we have talked about link to the\nreproductive pr ocess? W e must r emember that the sexual mode of\nreproduction means that germ-cells from two individuals have to join\ntogether . This can happen by the exter nal release of ger m-cells fr om the\nbodies of individuals, as happens in flowering plants. Or it can happen\nby two individuals joining their bodies together for internal transfer of\ngerm-cells for fusion, as happens in many animals. If animals are to\n2024-25\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce? 123participate in this process of mating, their state of sexual maturity must\nbe identifiable by other individuals. Many changes during puberty, such\nas new hair -growth patter ns, ar e signals that sexual maturation is taking\nplace.\nOn the other hand, the actual transfer of germ-cells between two\npeople needs special organs for the sexual act, such as the penis when it\nis capable of becoming erect. In mammals such as humans, the baby is\ncarried in the mother\u2019s body for a long period, and will be breast-fed\nlater. The female r eproductive or gans and br easts will need to matur e to\naccommodate these possibilities. Let us look at the systems involved in\nthe process of sexual reproduction.\n7.3.3 (a) Male Reproductive System\nThe male reproductive system (Fig. 7.10)\nconsists of portions which produce the\ngerm-cells and other portions that deliver\nthe germ-cells to the site of fertilisation.\nThe formation of germ-cells or sperms\ntakes place in the testes. These are located\noutside the abdominal cavity in scrotum\nbecause sperm formation requires a lower\ntemperature than the normal body\ntemperatur e. We have discussed the r ole of the\ntestes in the secretion of the hormone,\ntestoster one, in the pr evious chapter . In\naddition to regulating the formation of sperms,\ntestosterone brings about changes in\nappearance seen in boys at the time of puberty.\nThe sperms formed are delivered\nthrough the vas deferens which unites with\na tube coming fr om the urinary bladder . The\nurethra thus forms a common passage for\nboth the sperms and urine. Along the path\nof the vas deferens, glands like the prostate\nand the seminal vesicles add their secretions\nso that the sperms are now in a fluid which\nmakes their transport easier and this fluid\nalso provides nutrition. The sperms are tiny\nbodies that consist of mainly genetic\nmaterial and a long tail that helps them to\nmove towards the female germ-cell.\n7.3.3 (b) Female Reproductive System\nThe female germ-cells or eggs are made in\nthe ovaries. They are also responsible for the\nproduction of some hormones. Look at\nFig. 7.11 and identify the various organs in\nthe female reproductive system.\nFigure 7.10 Figure 7.10 Figure 7.10 Figure 7.10 Figure 7.10 Huma n\u2013male reproductive system\nFigure 7.11 Figure 7.11 Figure 7.11 Figure 7.11 Figure 7.11 Huma n\u2013female reproductive system\n2024-25\n\nScience 124When a girl is born, the ovaries already contain thousands of\nimmature eggs. On reaching puberty, some of these start maturing. One\negg is produced every month by one of the ovaries. The egg is carried\nfrom the ovary to the womb through a thin oviduct or fallopian tube.\nThe two oviducts unite into an elastic bag-like structure known as the\nuterus. The uterus opens into the vagina through the cervix.\nThe sperms enter through the vaginal passage during sexual\nintercourse. They travel upwards and reach the oviduct where they may\nencounter the egg. The fertilised egg (zygote) starts dividing and form a\nball of cells or embryo. The embryo i s implanted in the li ning of the uterus\nwhere they continue to gr ow and develop or gans to become foetus. W e\nhave seen in earlier sections that the mother\u2019s body is designed to\nundertake the development of the child. Hence the uterus prepares itself\nevery month to receive and nurture the growing embryo. The lining\nthickens and is richly supplied with blood to nourish the growing embryo.\nThe embryo gets nutrition from the mother\u2019s blood with the help of a\nspecial tissue called placenta. This is a disc which is embedded in the\nuterine wall. It contains villi on the embryo\u2019s side of the tissue. On the\nmother\u2019s side are blood spaces, which surround the villi. This provides\na large surface area for glucose and oxygen to pass from the mother to\nthe embryo. The developing embryo will also generate waste substances\nwhich can be removed by transferring them into the mother\u2019s blood\nthrough the placenta. The development of the child inside the mother\u2019s\nbody takes approximately nine months. The child is born as a result of\nrhythmic contractions of the muscles in the uterus.\n7.3.3 (c) What happens when the Egg is not F ertilised?\nIf the egg is not fertilised, it lives for about one day. Since the ovary\nreleases one egg every month, the uterus also prepares itself every month\nto receive a fertilised egg. Thus its lining becomes thick and spongy.\nThis would be required for nourishing the embryo if fertilisation had\ntaken place. Now, however , this lining is not needed any longer . So, the\nlining slowly breaks and comes out through the vagina as blood and\nmucous. This cycle takes place roughly every month and is known as\nmenstruation. It usually lasts for about two to eight days.\n7.3.3 (d) Reproductive Health\nAs we have seen, the process of sexual maturation is gradual, and takes\nplace while general body growth is still going on. Therefore, some degree\nof sexual maturation does not necessarily mean that the body or the\nmind is ready for sexual acts or for having and bringing up children.\nHow do we decide if the body or the mind is ready for this major\nresponsibility? All of us are under many different kinds of pressures\nabout these issues. There can be pressure from our friends for\nparticipating in many activities, whether we really want to or not. There\ncan be pressure from families to get married and start having children.\nThere can be pressure from government agencies to avoid having\nchildren. In this situation, making choices can become very difficult.\n2024-25\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce? 125We must also consider the possible health consequences of having\nsex. W e have discussed in Class IX that diseases can be transmitted\nfrom person to person in a variety of ways. Since the sexual act is a\nvery intimate connection of bodies, it is not surprising that many\ndiseases can be sexually transmitted. These include bacterial infections\nsuch as gonorrhoea and syphilis, and viral infections such as warts\nand HIV-AIDS. Is it possible to prevent the transmission of such diseases\nduring the sexual act? Using a covering, called a condom, for the penis\nduring sex helps to prevent transmission of many of these infections to\nsome extent.\nThe sexual act always has the potential to lead to pregnancy.\nPregnancy will make major demands on the body and the mind of the\nwoman, and if she is not ready for it, her health will be adversely\naffected. Therefore, many ways have been devised to avoid pregnancy.\nThese contraceptive methods fall in a number of categories. One\ncategory is the creation of a mechanical barrier so that sperm does not\nreach the egg. Condoms on the penis or similar coverings worn in the\nvagina can serve this purpose. Another category of contraceptives acts\nby changing the hormonal balance of the body so that eggs are not\nreleased and fertilisation cannot occur . These drugs commonly need\nto be taken orally as pills. However , since they change hor monal\nbalances, they can cause side -effects too. Other contraceptive devices\nsuch as the loop or the copper -T are placed in the uterus to pr event\npregnancy. Again, they can cause side effects due to irritation of the\nuterus. If the vas deferens in the male is blocked, sperm transfer will\nbe prevented. If the fallopian tube in the female is blocked, the egg will\nnot be able to reach the uterus. In both cases fertilisation will not take\nplace. Surgical methods can be used to create such blocks. While\nsurgical methods are safe in the long run, surgery itself can cause\ninfections and other problems if not performed properly. Surgery can\nalso be used for removal of unwanted pregnancies. These may be\nmisused by people who do not want a particular child, as happens in\nillegal sex-selective abortion of female foetuses. For a healthy society,\nthe female-male sex ratio must be maintained. Because of reckless\nfemale foeticides, child sex ratio is declining at an alarming rate in\nsome sections of our society, although prenatal sex determination has\nbeen prohibited by law.\nWe have noted earlier that r eproduction is the pr\nocess by which\norganisms increase their populations. The rates of birth and death in a\ngiven population will determine its size. The size of the human population\nis a cause for concern for many people. This is because an expanding\npopulation makes it harder to improve everybody\u2019s standard of living.\nHowever , if inequality in society is the main r eason for poor standar ds of\nliving for many people, the size of the population is relatively unimportant.\nIf we look around us, what can we identify as the most important\nreason(s) for poor living standards?\n2024-25\n\nScience 126What y ou hav e learnt\n/square6Reproduction, unlike other life processes, is not essential to maintain the life of an\nindividual organism.\n/square6Reproduction involves creation of a DNA copy and additional cellular apparatus\nby the cell involved in the process.\n/square6Various or ganisms use dif ferent modes of r eproduction depending on their body\ndesign.\n/square6In fission, many bacteria and protozoa simply divide into two or more daughter\ncells.\n/square6Organisms such as hydra can regenerate if they are broken into pieces.

The rules of heredity determine\nthe process by which traits and characteristics are reliably inherited. Let\nus take a closer look at these rules.\n8.2.1 Inherited T raits\nWhat exactly do we mean by similarities and dif ferences? W e know that\na child bears all the basic featur es of a human being. However , it does\nnot look exactly like its parents, and human populations show a great\ndeal of variation.QUESTIONS\n?1.

Find out about the\nearlobes of the parents of each student in the class. Correlate the\nearlobe type of each student with that of their parents. Based on\nthis evidence, suggest a possible rule for the inheritance of earlobe\ntypes.\n8.2.2 Rules for the Inheritance of T raits \u2013 \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\nMendel\u2019s Contributions\nThe rules for inheritance of such traits in human beings are related to\nthe fact that both the father and the mother contribute practically equal\namounts of genetic material to the child. This means that each trait can\nbe influenced by both paternal and maternal DNA. Thus, for each trait\nthere will be two versions in each child. What will, then, the trait seen in\nthe child be? Mendel (see box) worked out the main rules of such\ninheritance, and it is interesting to look at some of his experiments from\nmore than a century ago.Figure 8.2Figure 8.2Figure 8.2Figure 8.2Figure 8.2\n(a) Free and (b) attached\nearlobes. The lowest part\nof the ear , called the\nearlobe, is closely attached\nto the side of the head in\nsome of us, and not\nin others. Free and\nattached earlobes are two\nvariants found in human\npopulations.different kinds of advantages. Bacteria that can withstand heat will survive\nbetter in a heat wave, as we have discussed earlier . Selection of variants\nby environmental factors forms the basis for evolutionary processes, as\nwe will discuss in later sections.\n(a)\n(b)\n2024-25\n\nScience 130Mendel used a number of contrasting visible characters of garden\npeas \u2013 round/wrinkled seeds, tall/short plants, white/violet flowers and\nso on.  He took pea plants with different characteristics \u2013 a tall plant and\na short plant, produced progeny by crossing them, and calculated the\npercentages of tall or short progeny.\nIn the first place, there were no halfway characteristics in this first-\ngeneration, or F1 progeny \u2013 no \u2018medium-height\u2019 plants. All plants were\ntall. This meant that only one of the parental traits\nwas seen, not some mixture of the two. So the next\nquestion was, were the tall plants in the F1\ngeneration exactly the same as the tall plants of the\nparent generation? Mendelian experiments test this\nby getting both the parental plants and these F1 tall\nplants to reproduce by self-pollination. The progeny\nof the par ental plants ar e, of course, all tall. However ,\nthe second-generation, or F2, progeny of the F1 tall\nplants are not all tall. Instead, one quarter of them\nare short. This indicates that both the tallness and\nshortness traits were inherited in the F1 plants, but\nonly the tallness trait was expressed. This led Mendel\nto propose that two copies of factor (now called genes)\ncontrolling traits are present in sexually reproducing\norganism. These two may be identical, or may be\ndifferent, depending on the parentage. A pattern of\ninheritance can be worked out with this assumption,\nas shown in Fig. 8.3.Gregor Johann Mendel (1822\u20131884)\nMendel was educated in a monastery and went on to study science and\nmathematics at the University of Vienna. Failure in the examinations for a\nteaching certificate did not suppress his zeal for scientific quest. He went\nback to his monastery and started growing peas. Many others had studied\nthe inheritance of traits in peas and other or\nganisms earlier , but Mendel\nblended his knowledge of science and mathematics and was the first one\nto keep count of individuals exhibiting a particular trait in each generation.\nThis helped him to arrive at the laws of inheritance.\nFigure 8.3Figure 8.3Figure 8.3Figure 8.3Figure 8.3\nInheritance of traits\nover two generations Activity 8.2Activity 8.2Activity 8.2Activity 8.2Activity 8.2\n/square6In Fig. 8.3, what experiment would we do to confirm that the F2\ngeneration did in fact have a 1:2:1 ratio of TT, Tt and tt trait\ncombinations?\nIn this explanation, both TT and Tt are tall plants, while only tt is a\nshort plant. In other words, a single copy of \u2018T\u2019 is enough to make the\nplant tall, while both copies have to be \u2018t\u2019 for the plant to be short. T raits\nlike \u2018T\u2019 are called dominant traits, while those that behave like \u2018t\u2019 are\ncalled r ecessive traits. W ork out which trait would be consider ed\ndominant and which one recessive in Fig. 8.4.\n2024-25\n\nHeredity 131\nx\nRR yy\n(round, green)rr YY\n(wrinkled, yellow)\nRy\n rY\nRr Yy\n(round, yellow)F1\nx\nRr Yy\nF1Rr Yy\nF1\n315 round, yellow\n108 round, green\n101 wrinkled, yellow\n32 wrinkled, green\n9\n3\n3\n1\n556 seeds16\nFigure 9.5 Independent inheritance of two\nseparate traits, shape and colour of seeds\nRY Ry rY ry\nRY\nRy\nrY\nryRRYY RRYy RrYY RrYy\nRRYy RRyy RrYy Rryy\nRrYY RrYy rrYY rrYy\nRrYy Rryy rrYy rryyF2\nFigure 8.5Figure 8.5Figure 8.5Figure 8.5Figure 8.5\nIndependent inheritance\nof two separate traits,\nshape and colour of seedsWhat happens when pea plants showing two different\ncharacteristics, rather than just one, are bred with each other?\nWhat do the progeny of a tall plant with round seeds and a short\nplant with wrinkled-seeds look like? They are all tall and have\nround seeds. Tallness and round seeds are thus dominant traits.\nBut what happens when these F1 progeny are used to generate\nF2 progeny by self-pollination? A Mendelian experiment will find\nthat some F2 progeny are tall plants with round seeds, and some\nwere short plants with wrinkled seeds.  However , ther e would also\nbe some F2 progeny that showed new combinations. Some of them\nwould be tall, but have wrinkled seeds, while others would be short,\nbut have r ound seeds. Y ou can see as to how new combinations of\ntraits are formed in F2 offspring when factors controlling for seed\nshape and seed colour recombine to form zygote leading to form\nF2 offspring (Fig. 8.5). Thus, the tall/short trait and the round\nseed/wrinkled seed trait are independently inherited.\n8.2.3 How do these T raits get Expressed?\nHow does the mechanism of heredity work? Cellular DNA is\nthe information source for making proteins in the cell. A section\nof DNA that provides information for one protein is called the\ngene for that protein. How do proteins control the\ncharacteristics that we are discussing here? Let us take the\nexample of tallness as a characteristic. W e know that plants\nhave hormones that can trigger growth. Plant height can thus\ndepend on the amount of a particular plant hormone. The\namount of the plant hormone made will depend on the\nefficiency of the process for making it. Consider now an enzyme\nthat is important for this process. If this enzyme works\nefficiently, a lot of hormone will be made, and the plant will be\ntall. If the gene for that enzyme has an alteration that makes\nthe enzyme less efficient, the amount of hormone will be less,\nand the plant will be short. Thus, genes control characteristics,\nor traits.\nIf the interpretations of Mendelian experiments we have been\ndiscussing are correct, then both parents must be contributing\nequally to the DNA of the progeny during sexual reproduction.\nWe have disscussed this issue in the pr evious Chapter . If both\nparents can help determine the trait in the progeny, both parents\nmust be contributing a copy of the same gene. This means that\neach pea plant must have two sets of all genes, one inherited from\neach parent. For this mechanism to work, each germ cell must\nhave only one gene set.\nHow do germ-cells make a single set of genes from the normal two\ncopies that all other cells in the body have? If progeny plants inherited a\nsingle whole gene set from each parent, then the experiment explained\nin Fig. 8.5 cannot work. This is because the two characteristics \u2018R\u2019 and\n\u2018y\u2019 would then be linked to each other and cannot be independentlyFigure 8.4Figure 8.4Figure 8.4Figure 8.4Figure 8.4\n2024-25\n\nScience 132inherited. This is explained by the fact that each gene set is present, not\nas a single long thread of DNA, but as separate independent pieces,\neach called a chromosome. Thus, each cell will have two copies of each\nchromosome, one each from the male and female parents. Every germ-\ncell will take one chromosome from each pair and these may be of either\nmaternal or paternal origin. When two germ cells combine, they will\nrestore the normal number of chromosomes in the progeny, ensuring\nthe stability of the DNA of the species. Such a mechanism of inheritance\nexplains the results of the Mendel experiments, and is used by all\nsexually reproducing organisms. But asexually reproducing organisms\nalso follow similar rules of inheritance. Can we work out how their\ninheritance might work?\n8.2.4 Se x Deter mination\nWe have discussed the idea that the two sexes participating in sexual\nreproduction must be somewhat different from each other for a number\nof reasons. How is the sex of a newborn individual\ndetermined? Different species use very different strategies\nfor this. Some rely entirely on environmental cues. Thus,\nin some animals like a few reptiles, the temperature at\nwhich fertilised eggs are kept determines whether the\nanimals developing in the eggs will be male or female. In\nother animals, such as snails, individuals can change sex,\nindicating that sex is not genetically deter mined. However ,\nin human beings, the sex of the individual is largely\ngenetically determined. In other words, the genes inherited\nfrom our parents decide whether we will be boys or girls.\nBut so far , we have assumed that similar gene sets ar\ne\ninherited from both parents. If that is the case, how can\ngenetic inheritance determine sex?\nThe explanation lies in the fact that all human\nchromosomes are not paired. Most human chromosomes\nhave a maternal and a paternal copy, and we have 22\nsuch pairs. But one pair , called the sex chr omosomes, is\nodd in not always being a per fect pair . Women have a\nperfect pair of sex chromosomes, both called X. But men\nhave a mismatched pair in which one is a normal-sized X\nwhile the other is a short one called Y . So women ar e XX,\nwhile men ar e XY. Now, can we work out what the\ninheritance pattern of X and Y will be?\nAs Fig. 8.6 shows, half the children will be boys and\nhalf will be girls. All children will inherit an X chromosome\nfrom their mother regardless of whether they are boys or\ngirls. Thus, the sex of the children will be determined by\nwhat they inherit from their father . A child who inherits\nan X chromosome from her father will be a girl, and one\nwho inherits a Y chromosome from him will be a boy.Figure 8.6Figure 8.6Figure 8.6Figure 8.6Figure 8.6\nSex determination in\nhuman beings\n2024-25\n\nHeredity 133QUESTIONS\n?1. How do Mendel\u2019s experiments show that traits may be dominant or\nrecessive?\n2. How do Mendel\u2019s experiments show that traits are inherited\nindependently?\n3. A man with blood group A marries a woman with blood group O and\ntheir daughter has blood group O.

How is the sex of the child determined in human beings?\nWhat y ou hav e learnt\n/square6Variations arising during the pr ocess of r eproduction can be inherited.\n/square6These variations may lead to increased survival of the individuals.\n/square6Sexually reproducing individuals have two copies of genes for the same trait. If the\ncopies are not identical, the trait that gets expressed is called the dominant trait\nand the other is called the recessive trait.\n/square6Traits in one individual may be inherited separately, giving rise to new combinations\nof traits in the offspring of sexual reproduction.\n/square6Sex is determined by different factors in various species. In human beings, the\nsex of the child depends on whether the paternal chromosome is X (for girls) or Y\n(for boys).\nEXERCISES\n1.A Mendelian experiment consisted of breeding tall pea plants bearing violet flowers\nwith short pea plants bearing white flowers.

If we see a dog running, or a cow chewing cud, or a man\nshouting loudly on the street, we know that these are living beings. What\nif the dog or the cow or the man wer\ne asleep? W e would still think that\nthey wer e alive, but how did we know that? W e see them br eathing, and\nwe know that they are alive. What about plants? How do we know that\nthey ar e alive? W e see them gr een, some of us will say. But what about\nplants that have leaves of colours other than green? They grow over\ntime, so we know that they are alive, some will say. In other words, we\ntend to think of some sort of movement, either growth-related or not, as\ncommon evidence for being alive. But a plant that is not visibly growing is\nstill alive, and some animals can breathe without visible movement. So\nusing visible movement as the defining characteristic of life is not enough.\nMovements over very small scales will be invisible to the naked eye \u2013\nmovements of molecules, for example. Is this invisible molecular\nmovement necessary for life? If we ask this question to professional\nbiologists, they will say yes. In fact, viruses do not show any molecular\nmovement in them (until they infect some cell), and that is partly why\nthere is a controversy about whether they are truly alive or not.\nWhy ar e molecular movements needed for life? W e have seen in earlier\nclasses that living organisms are well-organised structures; they can\nhave tissues, tissues have cells, cells have smaller components in them,\nand so on. Because of the effects of the environment, this organised,\nordered nature of living structures is very likely to keep breaking down\nover time. If order breaks down, the organism will no longer be alive. So\nliving creatures must keep repairing and maintaining their structures.\nSince all these structures are made up of molecules, they must move\nmolecules around all the time.\nWhat are the maintenance processes in living organisms?\nLet us explore.\n5.1 WHA 5.1 WHA5.1 WHA 5.1 WHA5.1 WHA T ARE LIFE PROCESSES?T ARE LIFE PROCESSES?T ARE LIFE PROCESSES?T ARE LIFE PROCESSES?T ARE LIFE PROCESSES?\nThe maintenance functions of living organisms must go on even when\nthey ar e not doing anything particular . Even when we ar e just sitting in\n2024-25\n\nScience 80class, even if we are just asleep, this maintenance job has to go on.\nThe processes which together perform this maintenance job are\nlife processes.\nSince these maintenance processes are needed to prevent damage\nand break-down, energy is needed for them. This energy comes from\noutside the body of the individual organism. So there must be a process\nto transfer a source of energy from outside the body of the organism,\nwhich we call food, to the inside, a process we commonly call nutrition.\nIf the body size of the organisms is to grow, additional raw material will\nalso be needed from outside. Since life on earth depends on carbon-\nbased molecules, most of these food sources are also carbon-based.\nDepending on the complexity of these carbon sources, different\norganisms can then use different kinds of nutritional processes.\nThe outside sources of energy could be quite varied, since the\nenvironment is not under the control of the individual organism. These\nsources of energy, therefore, need to be broken down or built up in the\nbody, and must be finally converted to a uniform source of energy that\ncan be used for the various molecular movements needed for\nmaintaining living str uctures, as well as to the kind of molecules the\nbody needs to grow. For this, a series of chemical reactions in the\nbody \nare necessary. Oxidising-reducing reactions are some of the most\ncommon chemical means to break -down molecules. For this, many\norganisms use oxygen sourced from outside the body. The process\nof acquiring oxygen from outside the body, and to use it  in the process\nof break -down of food sources for cellular needs, is what we call\nrespiration.\nIn the case of a single-celled organism, no specific organs for taking\nin food, exchange of gases or removal of wastes may be needed because\nthe entire surface of the organism is in contact with the environment.\nBut what happens when the body size of the organism increases and\nthe body design becomes more complex? In multi-cellular organisms,\nall the cells may not be in direct contact with the surrounding\nenvironment. Thus, simple diffusion will not meet the requirements of\nall the cells.\nWe have seen pr eviously how, in multi-cellular or ganisms, various\nbody parts have specialised in the functions they per form. We are familiar\nwith the idea of these specialised tissues, and with their organisation in\nthe body of the organism. It is therefore not surprising that the uptake\nof food and of oxygen will also be the function of specialised tissues.\nHowever , this poses a pr oblem, since the food and oxygen ar e now taken\nup at one place in the body of the organisms, while all parts of the body\nneed them. This situation creates a need for a transportation system for\ncarrying food and oxygen from one place to another in the body.\nWhen chemical reactions use the carbon source and the oxygen for\nenergy generation,  they create by-products that are not only useless\nfor the cells of the body, but could even be harmful. These waste by-\nproducts are  therefore needed to be removed from the body and discarded\noutside  by a process called excretion. Again, if the basic rules for body\n2024-25\n\nLife Processes 81design in multi-cellular organisms are followed, a specialised tissue for\nexcretion will be developed, which means that the transportation system\nwill need to transport waste away from cells to this excretory tissue.\nLet us consider these various processes, so essential to maintain\nlife, one by one.\nQUESTIONS\n?1. Why is diffusion insufficient to meet the oxygen requirements of multi-\ncellular organisms like humans?\n2. What criteria do we use to decide whether something is alive?\n3. What are outside raw materials used for by an organism?\n4. What processes would you consider essential for maintaining life?\n5.2 NUTRITION5.2 NUTRITION5.2 NUTRITION5.2 NUTRITION5.2 NUTRITION\nWhen we walk or ride a bicycle, we are using up energy. Even when we\nare not doing any apparent activity, energy is needed to maintain a\nstate of or der in our body. W e also need materials fr om outside in or der\nto grow, develop, synthesise protein and other substances needed in\nthe body. This source of energy and materials is the food we eat.\nHow do living things get their food?\nThe general requirement for energy and materials is common in all\norganisms, but it is fulfilled in different ways. Some organisms use simple\nfood material obtained from inorganic sources in the form of carbon\ndioxide and water . These or ganisms, the autotr ophs, include gr\neen\nplants and some bacteria. Other organisms utilise complex substances.\nThese complex substances have to be broken down into simpler ones\nbefore they can be used for the upkeep and growth of the body. To\nachieve this, organisms use bio-catalysts called enzymes. Thus, the\nheterotrophs survival depends directly or indirectly on autotrophs.\nHeterotrophic organisms include animals and fungi.\n5.2.1 Autotrophic Nutrition\nCarbon and energy requirements of the autotrophic organism are\nfulfilled by photosynthesis. It is the process by which autotrophs take\nin substances from the outside and convert them into stored forms of\nenergy. This material is taken in the form of carbon dioxide and water\nwhich is converted into carbohydrates in the presence of sunlight and\nchlorophyll. Carbohydrates are utilised for providing energy to the plant.\nWe will study how this takes place in the next section. The carbohydrates\nwhich are not used immediately are stored in the form of starch, which\nserves as the internal energy reserve to be used as and when required\nby the plant. A somewhat similar situation is seen in us where some of\nthe energy derived from the food we eat is stored in our body in the form\nof glycogen.\n2024-25\n\nScience 82Let us now see what actually happens during the process of\nphotosynthesis. The following events occur during this process \u2013\nFigure 5.2Figure 5.2Figure 5.2Figure 5.2Figure 5.2\nVariegated leaf (a) befor e\nand (b) after starch testFigure 5.1Figure 5.1Figure 5.1Figure 5.1Figure 5.1\nCross-section of a leaf\nActivity 5.1Activity 5.1Activity 5.1Activity 5.1Activity 5.1\n/square6Take a potted plant with variegated leaves \u2013 for example, money plant\nor crotons.\n/square6Keep the plant in a dark room for three days so that all the starch\ngets used up.\n/square6Now keep the plant in sunlight for about six hours.\n/square6Pluck a leaf from the plant. Mark the green areas in it and trace them\non a sheet of paper .\n/square6Dip the leaf in boiling water for a few minutes.\n/square6After this, immerse it in a beaker containing alcohol.\n/square6Carefully place the above beaker in a water -bath and heat till the\nalcohol begins to boil.\n/square6What happens to the colour of the leaf? What is the colour of the\nsolution?\n/square6Now dip the leaf in a dilute solution of iodine for a few minutes.\n/square6Take out the leaf and rinse off the iodine solution.\n/square6Observe the colour of the leaf and compare this with the tracing of\nthe leaf done in the beginning (Fig. 5.2).\n/square6What can you conclude about the presence of starch in various areas\nof the leaf?(i)Absorption of light energy by\nchlorophyll.\n(ii)Conversion of light energy to chemical\nenergy and splitting of water molecules\ninto hydrogen and oxygen.\n(iii)Reduction of carbon dioxide to\ncarbohydrates.\nThese steps need not take place one after\nthe other immediately. For example, desert\nplants take up carbon dioxide at night and\nprepare an intermediate which is acted upon\nby the energy absorbed by the chlorophyll\nduring the day.\nLet us see how each of the components of\nthe above reaction are necessary for\nphotosynthesis.\nIf you carefully observe a cross-section of a\nleaf under the microscope (shown in Fig. 5.1),\nyou will notice that some cells contain green\ndots. These green dots are cell organelles called\nchloroplasts which contain chlorophyll. Let us\ndo an activity which demonstrates that\nchlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis.\n2024-25\n\nLife Processes 83Now, let us study how the plant\nobtains carbon dioxide. In Class IX,\nwe had talked about stomata (Fig. 5.3)\nwhich are tiny pores present on the\nsurface of the leaves. Massive amounts\nof gaseous exchange takes place in the\nleaves through these pores for the\npurpose of photosynthesis. But it is\nimportant to note here that exchange\nof gases occurs across the surface of\nstems, roots and leaves as well. Since\nlarge amounts of water can also be lost\nthrough these stomata, the plant\ncloses these pores when it does not\nneed carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. The opening and closing of the\npore is a function of the guard cells. The guard cells swell when water\nflows into them, causing the stomatal pore to open. Similarly the pore\ncloses if the guard cells shrink.\n/square6Take two healthy potted plants\nwhich are nearly the same size.\n/square6Keep them in a dark room for\nthree days.\n/square6Now place each plant on\nseparate glass plates. Place a\nwatch-glass containing potassium\nhydroxide by the side of one of\nthe plants. The potassium\nhydroxide is used to absorb\ncarbon dioxide.\n/square6Cover both plants with separate\nbell-jars as shown in Fig. 5.4.\n/square6Use vaseline to seal the bottom\nof the jars to the glass plates so\nthat the set-up is air -tight.\n/square6Keep the plants in sunlight for\nabout two hours.\n/square6Pluck a leaf from each plant and check for the presence of starch as in the above activity.\n/square6Do both the leaves show the presence of the same amount of starch?\n/square6What can you conclude from this activity?Figure 5.3 Figure 5.3 Figure 5.3 Figure 5.3 Figure 5.3 (a) Open and (b) closed stomatal pore\nActivity 5.2Activity 5.2Activity 5.2Activity 5.2Activity 5.2\nBased on the two activities performed above, can we design an\nexperiment to demonstrate that sunlight is essential for photosynthesis?\nSo far , we have talked about how autotr ophs meet their ener gy\nrequirements. But they also need other raw materials for building their\nbody. W ater used in photosynthesis is taken up fr om the soil by the\nroots in terrestrial plants. Other materials like nitrogen, phosphorus,\niron and magnesium are taken up from the soil. Nitrogen is an essential\nelement used in the synthesis of proteins and other compounds. This isFigure 5.4  Experimental set-up (a) with potassium\nhydroxide (b) without potassium hydroxide\n(a) (b)\n2024-25\n\nScience 84taken up in the form of inorganic nitrates or nitrites. Or it is taken up as\norganic compounds which have been prepared by bacteria from\natmospheric nitrogen.\n5.2.2 Heterotrophic Nutrition\nEach organism is adapted to its environment. The form of nutrition\ndiffers depending on the type and availability of food material as well\nas how it is obtained by the organism. For example, whether the food\nsource is stationary (such as grass) or mobile (such as a deer), would\nallow for differences in how the food is accessed and what is the nutritive\napparatus used by a cow and a lion. There is a range of strategies by\nwhich the food is taken in and used by the organism. Some organisms\nbreak- down the food material outside the body and then absorb it.\nExamples are fungi like bread moulds, yeast and mushrooms. Others\ntake in whole material and break it down inside their bodies. What can\nbe taken in and broken down depends on the body design and\nfunctioning. Some other organisms derive nutrition from plants or\nanimals without killing them. This parasitic nutritive strategy is used\nby a wide variety of or ganisms like cuscuta (amar -bel),  ticks, lice,\nleeches and tape-worms.\n5.2.3 How do Organisms obtain their Nutrition?\nSince the food and the way it is obtained dif fer, the digestive system is\ndifferent in various organisms. In single-celled organisms, the food\nmay be taken in by the entire surface. But as the complexity of the\norganism increases, different parts become specialised to perform\ndifferent functions. For example, \nAmoeba takes in food using\ntemporary finger -like extensions of the cell sur face which fuse over\nthe food particle forming a food-vacuole (Fig. 5.5). Inside the food-\nvacuole, complex substances are broken down into simpler ones\nwhich then diffuse into the cytoplasm. The remaining undigested\nmaterial is moved to the surface of the cell and thrown out. In\nParamoecium , which is also a unicellular organism, the cell has a\ndefinite shape and food is taken in at a specific spot. Food is moved\nto this spot by the movement of cilia which cover the entire surface\nof the cell.\n5.2.4 Nutrition in Human Beings\nThe alimentary canal is basically a long tube extending from the mouth\nto the anus. In Fig. 5.6, we can see that the tube has different parts.\nVarious r egions ar e specialised to per form dif ferent functions. What\nhappens to the food once it enters our body? W e shall discuss this\nprocess here.Figure 5.5Figure 5.5Figure 5.5Figure 5.5Figure 5.5\nNutrition in Amoeba\n2024-25\n\nLife Processes 85Activity 5.3Activity 5.3Activity 5.3Activity 5.3Activity 5.3\n/square6Take 1 mL starch solution (1%) in two test tubes (A and B).\n/square6Add 1 mL saliva to test tube A and leave both test tubes undisturbed\nfor 20-30 minutes.\n/square6Now add a few drops of dilute iodine solution to the test tubes.\n/square6In which test tube do you observe a colour change?\n/square6What does this indicate about the presence or absence of starch\nin the two test tubes?\n/square6What does this tell us about the action of saliva on starch?\nWe eat various types of food which has to pass thr ough the same\ndigestive tract. Naturally the food has to be processed to generate\nparticles which are small and of the same texture. This is achieved by\ncrushing the food with our teeth. Since the lining of the canal is soft, the\nfood is also wetted to make its passage smooth. When we eat something\nwe like, our mouth \u2018waters\u2019. This is actually not only water , but a fluid\ncalled saliva secreted by the salivary glands. Another aspect of the food\nwe ingest is its complex nature. If it is to be absorbed from the alimentary\ncanal, it has to be broken into smaller molecules. This is done with the\nhelp of biological catalysts called\nenzymes. The saliva contains an\nenzyme called salivary amylase that\nbreaks down starch which is a complex\nmolecule to give simple sugar . The food\nis mixed thoroughly with saliva and\nmoved around the mouth while\nchewing by the muscular tongue.\nIt is necessary to move the food in\na regulated manner along the digestive\ntube so that it can be processed\nproperly in each part. The lining of\ncanal has muscles that contract\nrhythmically in order to push the food\nforward. These peristaltic movements\noccur all along the gut.\nFrom the mouth, the food is taken\nto the stomach through the food-pipe\nor oesophagus. The stomach is a large\norgan which expands when food\nenters it. The muscular walls of the\nstomach help in mixing the food\nthoroughly with more digestive juices.\nThe digestion in stomach is taken\ncare of by the gastric glands present in the wall of the stomach. These\nrelease hydrochloric acid, a protein digesting enzyme called pepsin,\nand mucus. The hydrochloric acid creates an acidic medium which\nfacilitates the action of the enzyme pepsin. What other function do you\nthink is served by the acid? The mucus protects the inner lining of the\nstomach fr om the action of the acid under nor mal conditions. W e\nFigure 5.6Figure 5.6Figure 5.6Figure 5.6Figure 5.6  Human alimentary canal\n2024-25\n\nScience 86have often heard adults complaining about \u2018acidity\u2019. Can this be related\nto what has been discussed above?\nThe exit of food from the stomach is regulated by a sphincter muscle\nwhich releases it in small amounts into the small intestine. From the\nstomach, the food now enters the small intestine. This is the longest part\nof the alimentary canal which is fitted into a compact space because of\nextensive coiling. The length of the small intestine differs in various\nanimals depending on the food they eat. Herbivores eating grass need a\nlonger small intestine to allow the cellulose to be digested. Meat is easier\nto digest, hence carnivores like tigers have a shorter small intestine.\nThe small intestine is the site of the complete digestion of\ncarbohydrates, proteins and fats. It receives the secretions of the liver\nand pancreas for this purpose. The food coming from the stomach is\nacidic and has to be made alkaline for the pancreatic enzymes to act.\nBile juice from the liver accomplishes this in addition to acting on fats.\nFats are present in the intestine in the form of large globules which makes\nit difficult for enzymes to act on them. Bile salts break them down into\nsmaller globules increasing the efficiency of enzyme action. This is similar\nto the emulsifying action of soaps on dirt that we have learnt about in\nChapter 4. The pancreas secretes pancreatic juice which contains\nenzymes like trypsin for digesting proteins and lipase for breaking down\nemulsified fats. The walls of the small intestine contain glands which\nsecrete intestinal juice. The enzymes present in it finally convert the\nproteins to amino acids, complex carbohydrates into glucose and fats\ninto fatty acids and glycerol.\nDigested food is taken up by the walls of the intestine. The inner\nlining of the small intestine has numer ous finger -like pr ojections called\nvilli which increase the surface area for absorption. The villi are richly\nsupplied with blood vessels which take the absorbed food to each and\nevery cell of the body, where it is utilised for obtaining energy, building\nup new tissues and the repair of old tissues.\nThe unabsorbed food is sent into the large intestine where its wall\nabsorb more water from this material. The rest of the material is removed\nfrom the body via the anus. The exit of this waste material is regulated\nby the anal sphincter .More to Know!Dental caries\nDental caries or tooth decay causes gradual softening of enamel and dentine. It begins\nwhen bacteria acting on sugars produce acids that softens or demineralises the enamel.\nMasses of bacterial cells together with food particles stick to the teeth to form dental\nplaque. Saliva cannot reach the tooth surface to neutralise the acid as plaque covers\nthe teeth. Brushing the teeth after eating removes the plaque before the bacteria\nproduce acids. If untreated, microorganisms may invade the pulp, causing\ninflammation and infection.\n2024-25\n\nLife Processes 875.3 RESPIR5.3 RESPIR5.3 RESPIR5.3 RESPIR5.3 RESPIR AAA AATION TIONTION TIONTION\nActivity 5.4Activity 5.4Activity 5.4Activity 5.4Activity 5.4\n/square6Take some freshly prepared lime\nwater in a test tube.\n/square6Blow air through this lime water .\n/square6Note how long it takes for the lime\nwater to turn milky.\n/square6Use a syringe or pichkari  to pass air\nthrough some fresh lime water\ntaken in another test tube (Fig. 5.7).\n/square6Note how long it takes for this lime\nwater to turn milky.\n/square6What does this tell us about the\namount of carbon dioxide in the air\nthat we breathe out?1.

The\nfood material taken in during the process of nutrition is used in cells to\nprovide energy for various life processes. Diverse organisms do this in\ndifferent ways \u2013 some use oxygen to break-down glucose completely\ninto carbon dioxide and water , some use other pathways that do not\ninvolve oxygen (Fig. 5.8). In all cases, the first step is the break-down of\nglucose, a six-carbon molecule, into a three-carbon molecule called\npyruvate. This pr ocess takes place in the cytoplasm. Further , the\npyruvate may be converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process\ntakes place in yeast during fermentation. Since this process takes place\nin the absence of air (oxygen), it is called anaerobic respiration. Break-\ndown of pyruvate using oxygen takes place in the mitochondria. ThisFigure 5.7Figure 5.7Figure 5.7Figure 5.7Figure 5.7\n(a) Air being passed into lime water with a pichkari/\nsyringe,  (b) air being exhaled into lime water\n2024-25\n\nScience 88process breaks up the three-carbon pyruvate molecule to give three\nmolecules of carbon dioxide. The other pr oduct is water . Since this\nprocess takes place in the presence of air (oxygen), it is called aerobic\nrespiration. The release of energy in this aerobic process is a lot greater\nthan in the anaerobic process. Sometimes, when there is a lack of oxygen\nin our muscle cells, another pathway for the break-down of pyruvate is\ntaken. Here the pyruvate is converted into lactic acid which is also a\nthree-carbon molecule. This build-up of lactic acid in our muscles during\nsudden activity causes cramps.\nFigure 5.8Figure 5.8Figure 5.8Figure 5.8Figure 5.8  Break-down of glucose by various pathways\nThe energy released during cellular respiration is immediately used\nto synthesise a molecule called ATP which is used to fuel all other\nactivities in the cell. In these processes, ATP is broken down giving rise\nto a fixed amount of energy which can drive the endothermic reactions\ntaking place in the cell.\nATP\nATP is the energy currency for most cellular processes. The energy released during\nthe process of respiration is used to make an ATP molecule from ADP and inorganic\nphosphate.\nEndothermic processes in the cell then use this ATP to drive the reactions. When the\nterminal phosphate linkage in A\nTP is br oken using water , the energy equivalent to\n30.5 kJ/mol is released.\nThink of how a battery can provide energy for many different kinds of uses. It can be\nused to obtain mechanical energy, light energy, electrical energy and so on. Similarly,\nATP can be used in the cells for the contraction of muscles, protein synthesis,\nconduction of nervous impulses and many other activities.\nSince the aerobic respiration pathway depends on oxygen, aerobic\norganisms need to ensur e that ther e is suf ficient intake of oxygen. W e\nhave seen that plants exchange gases through stomata, and the large\ninter-cellular spaces ensur e that all cells ar e in contact with air .

The dir ection of dif fusion\ndepends upon the environmental conditions and the requirements of\nthe plant. At night, when there is no photosynthesis occurring, CO2\nelimination is the major exchange activity going on. During the day,\nCO2 generated during respiration is used up for photosynthesis, hence\nthere is no CO2 release. Instead, oxygen release is the major event at\nthis time.\nAnimals have evolved different organs for the uptake of oxygen\nfrom the environment and for getting rid of the carbon dioxide\nproduced. Terrestrial animals can breathe the oxygen in the\natmosphere, but animals that live in water need to use the oxygen\ndissolved in water .\nActivity 5.6Activity 5.6Activity 5.6Activity 5.6Activity 5.6\n/square6Observe fish in an aquarium. They open and close their mouths\nand the gill-slits (or the operculum which covers the gill-slits)\nbehind their eyes also open and close. Are the timings of the\nopening and closing of the mouth and gill-slits coordinated in some\nmanner?\n/square6Count the number of times the fish opens and closes its mouth in\na minute.\n/square6Compare this to the number of times you breathe in and out in a\nminute.\nSince the amount of dissolved oxygen is fairly low compared\nto the amount of oxygen in the air , the rate of br\neathing in aquatic\norganisms is much faster than that seen in terrestrial organisms.\nFishes take in water through their mouths and force it past the\ngills where the dissolved oxygen is taken up by blood.\nTerrestrial organisms use the oxygen in the atmosphere for\nrespiration. This oxygen is absorbed by different organs in\ndifferent animals. All these organs have a structure that increases\nthe surface area which is in contact with the oxygen-rich\natmosphere. Since the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide\nhas to take place across this surface, this surface is very fine\nand delicate. In order to protect this surface, it is usually placed\nwithin the body, so there have to be passages that will take air\nto this area. In addition, there is a mechanism for moving the air\nin and out of this area where the oxygen is absorbed.\nIn human beings (Fig. 5.9), air is taken into the body through\nthe nostrils. The air passing through the nostrils is filtered by\nfine hairs that line the passage. The passage is also lined with\nmucus which helps in this process. From here, the air passes\nthrough the throat and into the lungs. Rings of cartilage are\npresent in the thr oat. These ensure that the air -passage does\nnot collapse.Using tobacco directly or\nany product of tobacco in\nthe for m of cigar , cigar ettes,\nbidis, hookah , gutkha\n, etc.,\nis harmful. Use of tobacco\nmost commonly affects the\ntongue, lungs, heart and\nliver. Smokeless tobacco is\nalso a major risk factor for\nheart attacks, strokes,\npulmonary diseases and\nseveral forms of cancers.\nThere is a high incidence of\noral cancer in India due to\nthe chewing of tobacco in\nthe form of gutkha . Stay\nhealthy; just say NO to\ntobacco and its products!More to Know!\n2024-25\n\nScience 90Within the lungs, the passage divides into smaller and smaller\ntubes which finally terminate in balloon-like structures which\nare called alveoli  (singular\u2013alveolus) . The alveoli provide a surface\nwhere the exchange of gases can take place. The walls of the alveoli\ncontain an extensive network of blood-vessels. As we have seen\nin earlier years, when we breathe in, we lift our ribs and flatten\nour diaphragm, and the chest cavity becomes larger as a result.\nBecause of this, air is sucked into the lungs and fills the expanded\nalveoli. The blood brings carbon dioxide from the rest of the body\nfor release into the alveoli, and the oxygen in the alveolar air is\ntaken up by blood in the alveolar blood vessels to be transported\nto all the cells in the body. During the breathing cycle, when air is\ntaken in and let out, the lungs always contain a residual volume\nof air so that there is sufficient time for oxygen to be absorbed\nand for the carbon dioxide to be released.\nWhen the body size of animals is large,  the diffusion pressure\nalone cannot take care of oxygen delivery to all parts of the body.\nInstead, respiratory pigments take up oxygen from the air in the\nlungs and carry it to tissues which are deficient in oxygen before\nreleasing it. In human beings, the respiratory pigment is\nhaemoglobin which has a very high affinity for oxygen. This pigment\nis present in the red blood corpuscles. Carbon dioxide is more\nsoluble in water than oxygen is and hence is mostly transported in\nthe dissolved form in our blood.\nFigure 5.9Figure 5.9Figure 5.9Figure 5.9Figure 5.9  Human respiratory system\nDo You Know?\nSmoking is injurious to\nhealth.\nLung cancer is one of\ncommon causes of\ndeaths in the world.

In Class IX, we learnt about blood\nbeing a fluid connective tissue. Blood consists of a fluid medium called\nplasma in which the cells are suspended. Plasma transports food, carbon\ndioxide and nitrogenous wastes in dissolved form. Oxygen is carried by\nthe red blood corpuscles. Many other substances like salts, are also\ntransported by the blood. W e thus need a pumping or gan to push blood\naround the body, a network of tubes to reach all the tissues and a system\nin place to ensure that this network can be repaired if damaged.\n2024-25\n\nScience 92The heart is a muscular organ which is\nas big as our fist (Fig. 5.10). Because\nboth oxygen and carbon dioxide have to\nbe transported by the blood, the heart\nhas different chambers to prevent the\noxygen-rich blood from mixing with the\nblood containing carbon dioxide. The\ncarbon dioxide-rich blood has to reach\nthe lungs for the carbon dioxide to be\nremoved, and the oxygenated blood from\nthe lungs has to be brought back to the\nheart. This oxygen-rich blood is then\npumped to the rest of the body.\nWe can follow this pr ocess step by\nstep (Fig. 5.11). Oxygen-rich blood from\nthe lungs comes to the thin-walled upper\nchamber of the heart on the left, the left atrium. The left atrium relaxes\nwhen it is collecting this blood. It then contracts, while the next chamber ,\nthe left ventricle, relaxes, so that the blood is transferred to it. When the\nmuscular left ventricle contracts in its turn, the blood is pumped out to\nthe body. De-oxygenated blood comes from the body to the upper\nchamber on the right, the right atrium, as it relaxes. As the right atrium\ncontracts, the corr esponding lower chamber , the right ventricle, dilates.\nThis transfers blood to the right ventricle, which in turn pumps it to the\nlungs for oxygenation. Since ventricles have to pump blood into various\norgans, they have thicker muscular walls than the atria do. V alves ensur e\nthat blood does not flow backwards when the atria or ventricles contract.\nOxygen enters the blood in the lungs\nThe separation of the right side and the left side of\nthe heart is useful to keep oxygenated and de-\noxygenated blood from mixing. Such separation\nallows a highly efficient supply of oxygen to the\nbody. This is useful in animals that have high\nenergy needs, such as birds and mammals, which\nconstantly use energy to maintain their body\ntemperature. In animals that do not use energy\nfor this purpose, the body temperature depends\non the temperature in the environment. Such\nanimals, like amphibians or  many reptiles have\nthree-chambered hearts, and tolerate some mixing\nof the oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood\nstreams. Fishes, on the other hand, have only two\nchambers to their hearts, and the blood is pumped\nto the gills, is oxygenated there, and passes directly\nto the rest of the body. Thus, blood goes only once\nthrough the heart in the fish during one cycle of\npassage through the body. On the other hand, it goes through the heart\ntwice during each cycle in other vertebrates. This is known as double\ncirculation.Our pump \u2014 the heart\nFigure 5.10Figure 5.10Figure 5.10Figure 5.10Figure 5.10\nSchematic sectional\nview of the human heart\nFigure 5.11Figure 5.11Figure 5.11Figure 5.11Figure 5.11\nSchematic representation of transport and exchange\nof oxygen and carbon dioxide\n2024-25\n\nLife Processes 93More to Know!\nBlood pr essur e is measur ed with an instrument called sphygmomanometer . High\nblood pressure is also called hypertension and is caused by the constriction of\narterioles, which results in increased resistance to blood flow. It can lead to the rupture\nof an artery and internal bleeding.Blood pressure\nThe force that blood exerts against the wall of a vessel is called blood pressure. This\npressure is much greater in arteries than in veins. The pressure of blood inside the\nartery during ventricular systole (contraction) is called systolic pressure and pressure\nin artery during ventricular diastole (relaxation) is called diastolic pressure. The normal\nsystolic pressure is about 120 mm of Hg and diastolic pressure is 80 mm of Hg.\nThe tubes \u2013 blood vessels\nArteries are the vessels which carry blood away from the heart to various\norgans of the body. Since the blood emerges from the heart under high\npressur e, the arteries have thick, elastic walls. V eins collect the blood\nfrom different organs and bring it back to the heart. They do not need\nthick walls because the blood is no longer under pressure, instead they\nhave valves that ensure that the blood flows only in one direction.\nOn reaching an organ or tissue, the artery divides into smaller and\nsmaller vessels to bring the blood in contact with all the individual cells.\nThe smallest vessels have walls which are one-cell thick and are called\ncapillaries. Exchange of material between the blood and surrounding\ncells takes place across this thin wall. The capillaries then join together\nto form veins that convey the blood away from the organ or tissue.\nMaintenance by platelets\nWhat happens if this system of tubes develops a leak? Think about\nsituations when we are injured and start bleeding. Naturally the loss of\nblood from the system has to be minimised. In addition, leakage would\nlead to a loss of pressure which would reduce the efficiency of the\n2024-25\n\nScience 94pumping system. To avoid this, the blood has platelet cells which circulate\naround the body and plug these leaks by helping to clot the blood at\nthese points of injury.\nLymph\nThere is another type of fluid also involved in transportation. This is\ncalled lymph or tissue fluid. Through the pores present in the walls of\ncapillaries some amount of plasma, proteins and blood cells escape into\nintercellular spaces in the tissues to form the tissue fluid or lymph. It is\nsimilar to the plasma of blood but colourless and contains less protein.\nLymph drains into lymphatic capillaries fr\nom the inter cellular spaces,\nwhich join to form large lymph vessels that finally open into larger veins.\nLymph carries digested and absorbed fat fr om intestine and drains excess\nfluid from extra cellular space back into the blood.\n5.4.2 T ranspor tation in Plants\nWe have discussed earlier how plants take in simple compounds such\nas CO2 and photosynthesise energy stored in their chlorophyll-containing\norgans, namely leaves. The other kinds of raw materials needed for\nbuilding plant bodies will also have to be taken up separately. For plants,\nthe soil is the nearest and richest source of raw materials like nitrogen,\nphosphorus and other minerals. The absorption of these substances\ntherefore occurs through the part in contact with the soil, namely roots.\nIf the distances between soil-contacting organs and chlorophyll-\ncontaining organs are small, energy and raw materials can easily diffuse\nto all parts of the plant body. But if these distances become large because\nof changes in plant body design, diffusion processes will not be sufficient\nto provide raw material in leaves and energy in roots. A proper system of\ntransportation is therefore essential in such situations.\nEnergy needs differ between different body designs. Plants do not\nmove, and plant bodies have a large proportion of dead cells in many\ntissues. As a result, plants have low energy needs, and can use relatively\nslow transport systems. The distances over which transport systems\nhave to operate, however , can be very lar ge in plants such as very tall\ntrees.\nPlant transport systems will move energy stores from leaves and raw\nmaterials from roots. These two pathways are constructed as\nindependently organised conducting tubes. One, the xylem  moves water\nand minerals obtained from the soil. The other , phloem transports\nproducts of photosynthesis from the leaves where they are synthesised\nto other parts of the plant. W e have studied the structur e of these tissues\nin detail in Class IX.\nTransport of water\nIn xylem tissue, vessels and tracheids of the roots, stems and leaves are\ninterconnected to for m a continuous system of water -conducting\nchannels reaching all parts of the plant. At the roots, cells in contact\nwith the soil actively take up ions. This creates a difference in the\nconcentration of these ions between the r oot and the soil. W ater, therefore,\n2024-25\n\nLife Processes 95moves into the root from the soil to eliminate this difference. This means\nthat there is steady movement of water into root xylem, creating a column\nof water that is steadily pushed upwards.\nHowever , this pr essur e by itself is unlikely to be enough to move\nwater over the heights that we commonly see in plants. Plants use another\nstrategy to move water in the xylem upwards to the highest points of the\nplant body.\nActivity 5.8Activity 5.8Activity 5.8Activity 5.8Activity 5.8\n/square6Take two small pots of approximately the same size and having\nthe same amount of soil. One should have a plant in it. Place a\nstick of the same height as the plant in the other pot.\n/square6Cover the soil in both pots with a plastic sheet so that moisture\ncannot escape by evaporation.\n/square6Cover both sets, one with the plant and the other with the stick,\nwith plastic sheets and place in bright sunlight for half an hour .\n/square6Do you observe any difference in the two cases?\nProvided that the plant has an adequate\nsupply of water , the water which is lost thr\nough the\nstomata is replaced by water from the xylem vessels\nin the leaf. In fact, evaporation of water molecules from\nthe cells of a leaf creates a suction which pulls water\nfrom the xylem cells of roots. The loss of water in the\nform of vapour from the aerial parts of the plant is\nknown as transpiration.\nThus, transpiration helps in the absorption and\nupward movement of water and minerals dissolved\nin it from roots to the leaves. It also helps in\ntemperature regulation.  The effect of root pressure in\ntransport of water is more important at night. During\nthe day when the stomata are open, the transpiration\npull becomes the major driving force in the movement\nof water in the xylem.\nTransport of food and other substances\nSo far we have discussed the transport of water and minerals in plants.\nNow let us consider how the products of metabolic processes, particularly\nphotosynthesis, are moved from leaves, where they are formed, to other\nparts of the plant. This transport of soluble products of photosynthesis\nis called translocation and it occurs in the part of the vascular tissue\nknown as phloem. Besides the products of photosynthesis, the phloem\ntransports amino acids and other substances. These substances are\nespecially delivered to the storage organs of roots, fruits and seeds and\nto growing organs. The translocation of food and other substances takes\nplace in the sieve tubes with the help of adjacent companion cells both\nin upward and downward directions.\nUnlike transport in xylem which can be largely explained by simple\nphysical forces, the translocation in phloem is achieved by utilising\nFigure 5.12Figure 5.12Figure 5.12Figure 5.12Figure 5.12\nMovement of water during transpiration in a tree\n2024-25\n\nScience 96energy. Material like sucrose is transferred into phloem tissue using\nenergy from A TP. This incr eases the osmotic pr essur e of the tissue\ncausing water to move into it. This pressure moves the material in the\nphloem to tissues which have less pressure. This allows the phloem to\nmove material according to the plant\u2019s needs. For example, in the spring,\nsugar stored in root or stem tissue would be transported to the buds\nwhich need energy to grow.\nQUESTIONS\n?1. What are the components of the transport system in human beings?\nWhat are the functions of these components?\n2. Why is it necessary to separate oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in\nmammals and birds?\n3. What are the components of the transport system in highly organised\nplants?\n4.

Other metabolic activities\ngenerate nitrogenous materials which need to be removed. The biological\nprocess involved in the removal of these harmful metabolic wastes from\nthe body is called excretion. Different organisms use varied strategies to\ndo this. Many unicellular organisms remove these wastes by simple\ndiffusion from the body surface into the surrounding\nwater . As we have seen in other processes, complex\nmulti-cellular organisms use specialised organs to\nperform the same function.\n5.5.1 Excretion in Human Beings\nThe excretory system of human beings (Fig. 5.13)\nincludes a pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters, a urinary\nbladder and a urethra. Kidneys are located in the\nabdomen, one on either side of the backbone. Urine\nproduced in the kidneys passes through the ureters\ninto the urinary bladder where it is stored until it is\nreleased through the urethra.\nHow is urine produced? The purpose of making\nurine is to filter out waste products from the blood.\nJust as CO2 is removed from the blood in the lungs,\nnitrogenous waste such as urea or uric acid are\nremoved from blood in the kidneys. It is then no\nsurprise that the basic filtration unit in the kidneys,\nFigure 5.13\nExcretory system in human beings\n2024-25\n\nLife Processes 97like in the lungs, is a cluster of very thin-walled blood\ncapillaries. Each capillary cluster in the kidney is\nassociated with the cup-shaped end of a coiled tube\ncalled Bowman\u2019s capsule that collects the filtrate\n (Fig. 5.14). Each kidney has large numbers of these\nfiltration units called nephr ons packed close together .\nSome substances in the initial filtrate, such as glucose,\namino acids, salts and a major amount of water , are\nselectively re-absorbed as the urine flows along the tube.\nThe amount of water re-absorbed depends on how much\nexcess water there is in the body, and on how much of\ndissolved waste there is to be excreted. The urine forming\nin each kidney eventually enters a long tube, the ur eter,\nwhich connects the kidneys with the urinary bladder .\nUrine is stored in the urinary bladder until the pressure\nof the expanded bladder leads to the urge to pass it out\nthrough the ur ethra. The bladder is muscular , so it is\nunder nervous control, as we have discussed elsewhere.\nAs a result, we can usually control the urge to urinate.\nMore to Know!Artificial kidney (Hemodialysis)\nKidneys are vital organs for survival. Several factors like infections, injury or restricted\nblood flow to kidneys reduce the activity of kidneys. This leads to accumulation of\npoisonous wastes in the body, which can even lead to death. In case of kidney\nfailure, an artificial kidney can be used. An artificial kidney is a device to remove\nnitrogenous waste products from the blood through dialysis.\nArtificial kidneys contain a number of tubes with a semi-permeable lining, suspended\nin a tank filled with dialysing fluid.\nThis fluid has the same osmotic\npressure as blood, except that it is\ndevoid of nitrogenous wastes. The\npatient\u2019s blood is passed through\nthese tubes. During this passage,\nthe waste products from the blood\npass into dialysing fluid by diffusion.\nThe purified blood is pumped back\ninto the patient. This is similar to the\nfunction of the kidney, but it is\ndifferent since there is no re-\nabsorption involved. Normally, in a\nhealthy adult, the initial filtrate in the\nkidneys is about 180 L daily.\nHowever , the volume actually\nexcreted is only a litre or two a day,\nbecause the remaining filtrate is re-\nabsorbed in the kidney tubules.\nFigure 5.14Figure 5.14Figure 5.14Figure 5.14Figure 5.14\nStructure of a nephron\n2024-25\n\nScience 985.5.2 Excretion in Plants\nPlants use completely different\nstrategies for excretion than those\nof animals. Oxygen itself can be\nthought of as a waste product\ngenerated during photosynthesis!\nWe have discussed earlier how\nplants deal with oxygen as well as\nCO2. They can get rid of excess water\nby transpiration. For other wastes,\nplants use the fact that many of\ntheir tissues consist of dead cells,\nand that they can even lose some\nparts such as leaves. Many plant\nwaste products are stored in\ncellular vacuoles. W aste pr\noducts\nmay be stored in leaves that fall off.\nOther waste products are stored as\nresins and gums, especially in old\nxylem. Plants also excrete some\nwaste substances into the soil\naround them.\nWhat y ou hav e learnt\n/square6Movement of various types can be taken as an indication of life.\n/square6Maintenance of life requires processes like nutrition, respiration, transport of\nmaterials within the body and excretion of waste products.\n/square6Autotrophic nutrition involves the intake of simple inorganic materials from the\nenvironment and using an external energy source like the Sun to synthesise complex\nhigh-energy organic material.\n/square6Heterotrophic nutrition involves the intake of complex material prepared by other\norganisms.\n/square6In human beings, the food eaten is broken down by various steps along the\nalimentary canal and the digested food is absorbed in the small intestine to be sent\nto all cells in the body.Think it over!\nOrgan donation\nOrgan donation is a generous act of donating an\norgan to a person who suffers from non-function of\norgan(s). Donation of an organ may be done by the\nconsent of the donor and his/her family. Anyone\nregardless of age or gender can become an organ\nand tissue donor . Organ transplants can save or\ntransfor m the life of a person. T ransplantation is\nrequired because recipient\u2019s organ has been\ndamaged or has failed by disease or injury. In organ\ntransplantation the organ is surgically removed\nfrom one person (organ donor) and transplanted to\nanother person (the recipient). Common\ntransplantations include corneas, kidneys, heart,\nliver, pancr eas, lungs, intestines and bone marr ow.\nMost organ and tissue donations occur just after\nthe donor has died or when the doctor declares a\nperson brain dead. But some organs such as\nkidney, part of a liver , lung, etc., and tissues can be\ndonated while the donor is alive.\n?QUESTIONS\n1. Describe the structure and functioning of nephrons.\n2.
